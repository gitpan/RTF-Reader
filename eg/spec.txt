Introduction
The Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification is a method of encoding formatted text and graphics for easy transfer between applications. Currently, users depend on special translation software to move word-processing documents between different MS-DOS®, Microsoft® Windows®, OS/2, Macintosh, and Power Macintosh applications.
The RTF Specification provides a format for text and graphics interchange that can be used with different output devices, operating environments, and operating systems. RTF uses the ANSI, PC-8, Macintosh, or IBM PC character set to control the representation and formatting of a document, both on the screen and in print. With the RTF Specification, documents created under different operating systems and with different software applications can be transferred between those operating systems and applications. RTF files created in Microsoft Word 6.0 (and later) for the Macintosh and Power Macintosh have a file type of RTF.
Software that takes a formatted file and turns it into an RTF file is called an RTF writer. An RTF writer separates the application's control information from the actual text and writes a new file containing the text and the RTF groups associated with that text. Software that translates an RTF file into a formatted file is called an RTF reader.
A sample RTF reader application is available (see Appendix A: Sample RTF Reader Application). It is designed for use with the specification to assist those interested in developing their own RTF readers. This application and its use are described in Appendix A. The sample RTF reader is not a for-sale product, and Microsoft does not provide technical or any other type of support for the sample RTF reader code or the RTF specification.
RTF version 1.7 includes all new control words introduced by Microsoft Word for Windows 95 version 7.0, Word 97 for Windows, Word 98 for the Macintosh, Word 2000 for Windows, and Word 2002 for Windows, as well as other Microsoft products.
RTF Syntax
An RTF file consists of unformatted text, control words, control symbols, and groups. For ease of transport, a standard RTF file can consist of only 7-bit ASCII characters. (Converters that communicate with Microsoft Word for Windows or Microsoft Word for the Macintosh should expect 8-bit characters.) There is no set maximum line length for an RTF file.
A control word is a specially formatted command that RTF uses to mark printer control codes and information that applications use to manage documents. A control word cannot be longer than 32 characters. A control word takes the following form:
\LetterSequence<Delimiter>
Note that a backslash begins each control word.
The LetterSequence is made up of lowercase alphabetic characters (a through z). RTF is case sensitive. Control words (also known as Keywords) may not contain any uppercase alphabetic characters.
The following keywords found in Word 97 through Word 2002 do not currently follow the requirement that keywords may not contain any uppercase alphabetic characters. All writers should still follow this rule, and Word will also emit completely lowercase versions of all these keywords in the next version. In the meantime, those implementing readers are advised to treat them as exceptions.

∑\clftsWidthN
∑\clNoWrap

∑\trftsWidthBN
∑\trftsWidthN
∑\trwWidthAN
∑\trwWidthBN
∑\trwWidthN
∑\sectspecifygenN
∑\ApplyBrkRules
The delimiter marks the end of an RTF control word, and can be one of the following:
∑A space. In this case, the space is part of the control word.
∑A digit or a hyphen (-), which indicates that a numeric parameter follows. The subsequent digital sequence is then delimited by a space or any character other than a letter or a digit. The parameter can be a positive or negative number. The range of the values for the number is generally 32767 through 32767. However, Word tends to restrict the range to 31680 through 31680. Word allows values in the range 2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648 for a small number of keywords (specifically \bin, \revdttm, and some picture properties). An RTF parser must handle an arbitrary string of digits as a legal value for a keyword. If a numeric parameter immediately follows the control word, this parameter becomes part of the control word. The control word is then delimited by a space or a nonalphabetic or nonnumeric character in the same manner as any other control word.
∑Any character other than a letter or a digit. In this case, the delimiting character terminates the control word but is not actually part of the control word.
If a space delimits the control word, the space does not appear in the document. Any characters following the delimiter, including spaces, will appear in the document. For this reason, you should use spaces only where necessary; do not use spaces merely to break up RTF code.
A control symbol consists of a backslash followed by a single, nonalphabetic character. For example, \~ represents a nonbreaking space. Control symbols take no delimiters.
A group consists of text and control words or control symbols enclosed in braces ( ). The opening brace ( ) indicates the start of the group and the closing brace ( ) indicates the end of the group. Each group specifies the text affected by the group and the different attributes of that text. The RTF file can also include groups for fonts, styles, screen color, pictures, footnotes, comments (annotations), headers and footers, summary information, fields, and bookmarks, as well as document-, section-, paragraph-, and character-formatting properties. If the font, file, style, screen color, revision mark, and summary-information groups and document-formatting properties are included, they must precede the first plain-text character in the document. These groups form the RTF file header. If the group for fonts is included, it should precede the group for styles. If any group is not used, it can be omitted. The groups are discussed in the following sections.
The control properties of certain control words (such as bold, italic, keep together, and so on) have only two states. When such a control word has no parameter or has a nonzero parameter, it is assumed that the control word turns on the property. When such a control word has a parameter of 0, it is assumed that the control word turns off the property. For example, \b turns on bold, whereas \b0 turns off bold.
Certain control words, referred to as destinations, mark the beginning of a collection of related text that could appear at another position, or destination, within the document. Destinations may also be text that is used but should not appear within the document at all. An example of a destination is the \footnote group, where the footnote text follows the control word. Page breaks cannot occur in destination text. Destination control words and their following text must be enclosed in braces. No other control words or text may appear within the destination group. Destinations added after the RTF Specification published in the March 1987 Microsoft Systems Journal may be preceded by the control symbol \*. This control symbol identifies destinations whose related text should be ignored if the RTF reader does not recognize the destination. (RTF writers should follow the convention of using this control symbol when adding new destinations or groups.) Destinations whose related text should be inserted into the document even if the RTF reader does not recognize the destination should not use \*. All destinations that were not included in the March 1987 revision of the RTF Specification are shown with \* as part of the control word.
Formatting specified within a group affects only the text within that group. Generally, text within a group inherits the formatting of the text in the preceding group. However, Microsoft implementations of RTF assume that the footnote, annotation, header, and footer groups (described later in this specification) do not inherit the formatting of the preceding text. Therefore, to ensure that these groups are always formatted correctly, you should set the formatting within these groups to the default with the \sectd, \pard, and \plain control words, and then add any desired formatting.
The control words, control symbols, and braces constitute control information. All other characters in the file are plain text. Here is an example of plain text that does not exist within a group:
\rtf\ansi\deff0\fonttbl\f0\froman Tms Rmn;\f1\fdecor

\nofpages1\nofwords0\nofchars0\vern8351\widoctrl\ftnbj \sectd\linex0\endnhere \pard\plain \fs20 This is plain text.\par

The phrase This is plain text. is not part of a group and is treated as document text.
As previously mentioned, the backslash (\) and braces ( ) have special meaning in RTF. To use these characters as text, precede them with a backslash, as in \\, \, and \.
Conventions of an RTF Reader
The reader of an RTF stream is concerned with the following:
∑Separating control information from plain text.
∑Acting on control information.
∑Collecting and properly inserting text into the document, as directed by the current group state.
Acting on control information is designed to be a relatively simple process. Some control information simply contributes special characters to the plain text stream. Other information serves to change the program state, which includes properties of the document as a whole, or to change any of a collection of group states, which apply to parts of the document.
As previously mentioned, a group state can specify the following:
∑The destination, or part of the document that the plain text is constructing.
∑Character-formatting properties, such as bold or italic.
∑Paragraph-formatting properties, such as justified or centered.
∑Section-formatting properties, such as the number of columns.
∑Table-formatting properties, which define the number of cells and dimensions of a table row.
In practice, an RTF reader will evaluate each character it reads in sequence as follows:
∑If the character is an opening brace (), the reader stores its current state on the stack. If the character is a closing brace (), the reader retrieves the current state from the stack.
∑If the character is a backslash (\), the reader collects the control word or control symbol and its parameter, if any, and looks up the control word or control symbol in a table that maps control words to actions. It then carries out the action prescribed in the lookup table. (The possible actions are discussed in the following table.) The read pointer is left before or after a control-word delimiter, as appropriate.
∑If the character is anything other than an opening brace (), closing brace (), or backslash (\), the reader assumes that the character is plain text and writes the character to the current destination using the current formatting properties.
If the RTF reader cannot find a particular control word or control symbol in the lookup table described in the preceding list, the control word or control symbol should be ignored. If a control word or control symbol is preceded by an opening brace (), it is part of a group. The current state should be saved on the stack, but no state change should occur. When a closing brace () is encountered, the current state should be retrieved from the stack, thereby resetting the current state. If the \* control symbol precedes a control word, then it defines a destination group and was itself preceded by an opening brace (). The RTF reader should discard all text up to and including the closing brace () that closes this group. All RTF readers must recognize all destinations defined in the March 1987 RTF Specification. The reader may skip past the group, but it is not allowed to simply discard the control word. Destinations defined since March 1987 are marked with the \* control symbol.
Note All RTF readers must implement the \* control symbol so that they can read RTF files written by newer RTF writers.
For control words or control symbols that the RTF reader can find in the lookup table, the possible actions are as follows.
ActionDescriptionChange DestinationThe RTF reader changes the destination to the destination described in the table entry. Destination changes are legal only immediately after an opening brace ( ). (Other restrictions may also apply; for example, footnotes cannot be nested.) Many destination changes imply that the current property settings will be reset to their default settings. Examples of control words that change destination are \footnote, \header, \footer, \pict, \info, \fonttbl, \stylesheet, and \colortbl. This specification identifies all destination control words where they appear in control-word tables.Change Formatting PropertyThe RTF reader changes the property as described in the table entry. The entry will specify whether a parameter is required. Appendix B: Index of RTF Control Words at the end of this Specification also specifies which control words require parameters. If a parameter is needed and not specified, then a default value will be used. The default value used depends on the control word. If the control word does not specify a default, then all RTF readers should assume a default of 0.Insert Special CharacterThe reader inserts into the document the character code or codes described in the table entry.Insert Special Character and Perform ActionThe reader inserts into the document the character code or codes described in the table entry and performs whatever other action the entry specifies. For example, when Microsoft Word interprets \par, a paragraph mark is inserted in the document and special code is run to record the paragraph properties belonging to that paragraph mark.Formal Syntax
RTF uses the following syntax, based on Backus-Naur Form.
SyntaxMeaning#PCDATAText (without control words).#SDATAHexadecimal data.#BDATABinary data.'c'A literal.<text>A nonterminal.AThe (terminal) control word a, without a parameter. a or aNThe (terminal) control word a, with a parameter.A?Item a is optional.A+One or more repetitions of item a.A*Zero or more repetitions of item a.A bItem a followed by item b.A | bItem a or item b.a & bItem a and/or item b, in any order.Contents of an RTF File
An RTF file has the following syntax:
<File>'' <header> <document> ''
This syntax is the standard RTF syntax; any RTF reader must be able to correctly interpret RTF written to this syntax. It is worth mentioning again that RTF readers do not have to use all control words, but they must be able to harmlessly ignore unknown (or unused) control words, and they must correctly skip over destinations marked with the \* control symbol. There may, however, be RTF writers that generate RTF that does not conform to this syntax, and as such, RTF readers should be robust enough to handle some minor variations. Nonetheless, if an RTF writer generates RTF conforming to this specification, then any correct RTF reader should be able to interpret it.
Header
The header has the following syntax:
<header>\rtf <charset> <deffont> \deff? <fonttbl> <filetbl>? <colortbl>? <stylesheet>? <listtables>? <revtbl>? <rsidtable>? <generator>?
Each of the various header tables should appear, if they exist, in this order. Document properties can occur before and between the header tables. A property must be defined before being referenced. Specifically,
∑The style sheet must occur before any style usage.
∑The font table must precede any reference to a font.
∑The \deff keyword must precede any text without an explicit reference to a font, because it specifies the font to use in such cases.
RTF Version
An entire RTF file is considered a group and must be enclosed in braces. The \rtfN control word must follow the opening brace. The numeric parameter N identifies the major version of the RTF Specification used. The RTF standard described in this specification, although titled as version 1.7, continues to correspond syntactically to RTF Specification version 1. Therefore, the numeric parameter N for the \rtf control word should still be emitted as 1.
Character Set
After specifying the RTF version, you must declare the character set used in this document. The control word for the character set must precede any plain text or any table control words. The RTF Specification currently supports the following character sets.

Control wordCharacter set\ansiANSI (the default)\macApple Macintosh\pcIBM PC code page 437\pcaIBM PC code page 850, used by IBM Personal System/2 (not implemented in version 1 of Microsoft Word for OS/2)Unicode RTF
Word 2002 is a Unicode-enabled application. Text is handled using the 16-bit Unicode character encoding scheme. Expressing this text in RTF requires a new mechanism, because until this release (version 1.6), RTF has only handled 7-bit characters directly and 8-bit characters encoded as hexadecimal. The Unicode mechanism described here can be applied to any RTF destination or body text.

Control wordMeaning\ansicpgNThis keyword represents the ANSI code page used to perform the Unicode to ANSI conversion when writing RTF text. N represents the code page in decimal. This is typically set to the default ANSI code page of the run-time environment (for example, \ansicpg1252 for U.S. Windows). The reader can use the same ANSI code page to convert ANSI text back to Unicode. Possible values include the following:
437United States IBM
708Arabic (ASMO 708)

This keyword should be emitted in the RTF header section right after the \ansi, \mac, \pc or \pca keyword.\uprThis keyword represents a destination with two embedded destinations, one represented using Unicode and the other using ANSI. This keyword operates in conjunction with the \ud keyword to provide backward compatibility. The general syntax is as follows:
\uprkeyword ansi_text\*\udkeyword Unicode_text
Notice that this keyword destination does not use the \* keyword; this forces the old RTF readers to pick up the ANSI representation and discard the Unicode one.\udThis is a destination that is represented in Unicode. The text is represented using a mixture of ANSI translation and use of \uN keywords to represent characters that do not have the exact ANSI equivalent.\uN This keyword represents a single Unicode character that has no equivalent ANSI representation based on the current ANSI code page. N represents the Unicode character value expressed as a decimal number.
This keyword is followed immediately by equivalent character(s) in ANSI representation. In this way, old readers will ignore the \uN keyword and pick up the ANSI representation properly. When this keyword is encountered, the reader should ignore the next N characters, where N corresponds to the last \ucN value encountered.
As with all RTF keywords, a keyword-terminating space may be present (before the ANSI characters) that is not counted in the characters to skip. While this is not likely to occur (or recommended), a \bin keyword, its argument, and the binary data that follows are considered one character for skipping purposes. If an RTF scope delimiter character (that is, an opening or closing brace) is encountered while scanning skippable data, the skippable data is considered to be ended before the delimiter. This makes it possible for a reader to perform some rudimentary error recovery. To include an RTF delimiter in skippable data, it must be represented using the appropriate control symbol (that is, escaped with a backslash,) as in plain text. Any RTF control word or symbol is considered a single character for the purposes of counting skippable characters.
An RTF writer, when it encounters a Unicode character with no corresponding ANSI character, should output \uN followed by the best ANSI representation it can manage. Also, if the Unicode character translates into an ANSI character stream with count of bytes differing from the current Unicode Character Byte Count, it should emit the \ucN keyword prior to the \uN keyword to notify the reader of the change.
RTF control words generally accept signed 16-bit numbers as arguments. For this reason, Unicode values greater than 32767 must be expressed as negative numbers.\ucNThis keyword represents the number of bytes corresponding to a given \uN Unicode character. This keyword may be used at any time, and values are scoped like character properties. That is, a \ucN keyword applies only to text following the keyword, and within the same (or deeper) nested braces. On exiting the group, the previous \uc value is restored. The reader must keep a stack of counts seen and use the most recent one to skip the appropriate number of characters when it encounters a \uN keyword. When leaving an RTF group that specified a \uc value, the reader must revert to the previous value. A default of 1 should be assumed if no \uc keyword has been seen in the current or outer scopes.
A common practice is to emit no ANSI representation for Unicode characters within a Unicode destination context (that is, inside a \ud destination). Typically, the destination will contain a \uc0 control sequence. There is no need to reset the count on leaving the \ud destination, because the scoping rules will ensure the previous value is restored.Document Text
Document text should be emitted as ANSI characters. If there are Unicode characters that do not have corresponding ANSI characters, they should be output using the \ucN and \uN keywords.
For example, the text LabGValue (Unicode characters 0x004c, 0x0061, 0x0062, 0x0393, 0x0056, 0x0061, 0x006c, 0x0075, 0x0065) should be represented as follows (assuming a previous \ucl):
Lab\u915GValue
Destination Text
Destination text is defined as any text represented in an RTF destination. A good example is the bookmark name in the \bkmkstart destination.
Any destination containing Unicode characters should be emitted as two destinations within a \upr destination to ensure that old readers can read it properly and that no Unicode character encoding is lost when read with a new reader.
For example, a bookmark name LabGValue (Unicode characters 0x004c, 0x0061, 0x0062, 0x0393, 0x0056, 0x0061, 0x006c, 0x0075, 0x0065) should be represented as follows:
\upr\*\bkmkstart LabGValue\*\ud\*\bkmkstart Lab\u915Value
The first subdestination contains only ANSI characters and is the representation that old readers will see. The second subdestination is a \*\ud destination that contains a second copy of the \bkmkstart destination. This copy can contain Unicode characters and is the representation that Unicode-aware readers must pay attention to, ignoring the ANSI-only version.
Default Fonts
Default font settings can be used to tell the program what regional settings are appropriate as defaults. For example, having a Japanese font set in \stshfdbchN would tell Word to enable Japanese formatting options. N refers to an entry in the font table.

<deffont>\stshfdbchN \stshflochN \stshfhichN \stshfbi\stshfdbchNDefines what font should be used by default in the style sheet for Far East characters. \stshflochNDefines what font should be used by default in the style sheet for ACSII characters.\stshfhichNDefines what font should be used by default in the style sheet for High-ANSI characters. \stshfbiDefines what font should be used by default in the style sheet for Complex Scripts (BiDi) characters. 
Default font settings can be used to tell the program what regional settings are appropriate as defaults. For example, having a Japanese font set in \stshfdbchN would tell Word to enable Japanese formatting options. N refers to an entry in the font table.
Font Table
The \fonttbl control word introduces the font table group. Unique \fN control words define each font available in the document, and are used to reference that font throughout the document. The font table group has the following syntax.
<fonttbl>'' \fonttbl (<fontinfo> | ('' <fontinfo> ''))+ ''<fontinfo><fontnum> <fontfamily> <fcharset>? <fprq>? <panose>? <nontaggedname>? <fontemb>? <codepage>? <fontname> <fontaltname>? ';' <fontnum>\f<fontfamily>\fnil | \froman | \fswiss | \fmodern | \fscript | \fdecor | \ftech | \fbidi<fcharset>\fcharset<fprq>\fprq<panose><data><nontaggedname>\*\fname<fontname>#PCDATA<fontaltname>'\*' \falt #PCDATA ''<fontemb>'\*' \fontemb <fonttype> <fontfname>? <data>? ''<fonttype>\ftnil | \fttruetype<fontfname>'\*' \fontfile <codepage>? #PCDATA ''<codepage>\cpg
Note for <fontemb> that either <fontfname> or <data> must be present, although both may be present.
All fonts available to the RTF writer can be included in the font table, even if the document doesn't use all the fonts.
RTF also supports font families so that applications can attempt to intelligently choose fonts if the exact font is not present on the reading system. RTF uses the following control words to describe the various font families.
Control wordFont familyExamples\fnilUnknown or default fonts (the default)Not applicable\fromanRoman, proportionally spaced serif fontsTimes New Roman, Palatino\fswissSwiss, proportionally spaced sans serif fontsArial\fmodernFixed-pitch serif and sans serif fontsCourier New, Pica\fscriptScript fontsCursive\fdecorDecorative fontsOld English, ITC Zapf Chancery\ftechTechnical, symbol, and mathematical fontsSymbol\fbidiArabic, Hebrew, or other bidirectional fontMiriam
If an RTF file uses a default font, the default font number is specified with the \deffN control word, which must precede the font-table group. The RTF writer supplies the default font number used in the creation of the document as the numeric argument N. The RTF reader then translates this number through the font table into the most similar font available on the reader's system.
The following control words specify the character set, alternative font name, pitch of a font in the font table, and nontagged font name.

Each byte represents a single font property as described by the Panose 1 standard specification.\*\fnameThis is an optional control word in the font table to define the nontagged font name. This is the actual name of the font without the tag, used to show which character set is being used. For example, Arial is a nontagged font name, and Arial (Cyrillic) is a tagged font name. This control word is used by WordPad. Word ignores this control word (and never creates it).\fbiasNUsed to arbitrate between two fonts when a particular character can exist in either non-Far East or Far East font. Word 97 through Word 2002 emit the \fbiasN keyword only in the context of bullets or list information (that is, a \listlevel destination). The default value of 0 for N indicates a non-Far East font. A value of 1 indicates a Far East font. Additional values may be defined in future releases.
If \fprq is specified, the N argument can be one of the following values.
PitchValueDefault pitchFixed pitch1Variable pitch2Font Embedding
RTF supports embedded fonts with the \fontemb group located inside a font definition. An embedded font can be specified by a file name, or the actual font data may be located inside the group. If a file name is specified, it is contained in the \fontfile group. The \cpg control word can be used to specify the character set for the file name.
RTF supports TrueType“ and other embedded fonts. The type of the embedded font is described by the following control words.
Control wordEmbedded font type\ftnilUnknown or default font type (the default)\fttruetypeTrueType fontCode Page Support
A font may have a different character set from the character set of the document. For example, the Symbol font has the same characters in the same positions both on the Macintosh and in Windows. RTF describes this with the \cpg control word, which names the character set used by the font. In addition, file names (used in field instructions and in embedded fonts) may not necessarily be the same as the character set of the document; the \cpg control word can change the character set for these file names as well. However, all RTF documents must still declare a character set (that is, \ansi, \mac, \pc, or \pca) to maintain backward compatibility with earlier RTF readers.
The following table describes valid values for \cpg.

The \filetbl control word introduces the file table destination. The only time a file table is created in RTF is when the document contains subdocuments. The file table group defines the files referenced in the document and has the following syntax:
<filetbl> '\*' \filetbl ('' <fileinfo> '')+ ''<fileinfo>\file <filenum><relpath>?<osnum>? <filesource>+ <file name><filenum>\fid <relpath>\frelative <osnum>\fosnum<filesource>\fvalidmac | \fvaliddos | \fvalidntfs | \fvalidhpfs | \fnetwork | \fnonfilesys<file name>#PCDATA
Note that the file name can be any valid alphanumeric string for the named file system, indicating the complete path and file name.
Control wordMeaning\filetblA list of documents referenced by the current document. The file table has a structure analogous to the style or font table. This is a destination control word output as part of the document header. \fileMarks the beginning of a file group, which lists relevant information about the referenced file. This is a destination control word.\fidNFile ID number. Files are referenced later in the document using this number.\frelativeNThe character position within the path (starting at 0) where the referenced file's path starts to be relative to the path of the owning document. For example, if a document is saved to the path C:\Private\Resume\File1.doc and its file table contains the path C:\Private\Resume\Edu\File2.doc, then that entry in the file table will be \frelative18, to point at the character "e" in "edu". This allows preservation of relative paths.\fosnumNCurrently only filled in for paths from the Macintosh file system. It is an operating systemspecific number for identifying the file, which may be used to speed up access to the file or find the file if it has been moved to another folder or disk. The Macintosh operating system name for this number is the "file id." Additional meanings of the \fosnumN control word may be defined for other file systems in the future.\fvalidmacMacintosh file system.\fvaliddosMS-DOS file system.\fvalidntfsNTFS file system.\fvalidhpfsHPFS file system.\fnetworkNetwork file system. This control word may be used in conjunction with any of the previous file source control words.\fnonfilesysIndicates http/odma.Color Table
The \colortbl control word introduces the color table group, which defines screen colors, character colors, and other color information. The color table group has the following syntax:
<colortbl>'' \colortbl <colordef>+ ''<colordef>\red ? & \green ? & \blue ? ';'
The following are valid control words for this group.
Control wordMeaning\redNRed index\greenNGreen index\blueNBlue index
Each definition must be delimited by a semicolon, even if the definition is omitted. If a color definition is omitted, the RTF reader uses its default color. The following example defines the default color table used by Word. The first color is omitted, as shown by the semicolon following the \colortbl control word. The missing definition indicates that color 0 is the auto color.
\colortbl;\red0\green0\blue0;\red0\green0\blue255;\red0\green255\blue255;\red0\green255\blue0;\red255\green0\blue255;\red255\green0\blue0;\red255\green255\blue0;\red255\green255\blue255;\red0\green0\blue128;\red0\green128\blue128;\red0\green128\blue0;\red128\green0\blue128;\red128\green0\blue0;\red128\green128\blue0;\red128\green128\blue128;\red192\green192\blue192;
The foreground and background colors use indexes into the color table to define a color. For more information on color setup, see your Windows documentation.
The following example defines a block of text in color (where supported). Note that the cf/cb index is the index of an entry in the color table, which represents a red/green/blue color combination.
\f1\cb1\cf2 This is colored text. The background is color1 and the foreground is color 2.
If the file is translated for software that does not display color, the reader ignores the color table group.
Style Sheet
The \stylesheet control word introduces the style sheet group, which contains definitions and descriptions of the various styles used in the document. All styles in the document's style sheet can be included, even if not all the styles are used. In RTF, a style is a form of shorthand used to specify a set of character, paragraph, or section formatting.
The style sheet group has the following syntax:
<stylesheet> '' \stylesheet <style>+ ''<style>'' <styledef>?<keycode>? <formatting> <additive>? <based>? <next>? <autoupd>? <hidden>? <personal>? <compose>? <reply>? <styleid>? <semihidden>? <stylename>? ';' ''<styledef>\s  |\*\cs  | \ds | \ts\tsrowd<keycode>'' \keycode <keys> ''<keys>( \shift? & \ctrl? & \alt?) <key><key>\fn | #PCDATA<additive>\additive<based>\sbasedon<next>\snext<autoupd>\sautoupd<hidden>\shidden<personal>\spersonal<compose>\scompose<reply>\sreply<formatting>(<brdrdef> | <parfmt> | <apoctl> | <tabdef> | <shading> | <chrfmt>)+<styleid>\styrsidN<semihidden>\ssemihidden<stylename>#PCDATA
For <style>, both <styledef> and <stylename> are optional; the default is paragraph style 0. Note for <stylename> that Microsoft Word for the Macintosh interprets commas in #PCDATA as separating style synonyms. Also, for <key>, the data must be exactly one character.
Control wordMeaning\*\csNDesignates character style. Like \s, \cs is not a destination control word. However, it is important to treat it like one inside the style sheet; that is, \cs must be prefixed with \* and must appear as the first item inside a group. Doing so ensures that readers that do not understand character styles will skip the character style information correctly. When used in body text to indicate that a character style has been applied, do not include the \* prefix.\sNDesignates paragraph style.\dsNDesignates section style.\tsNDesignates table style, in the same style as \cs for placement and prefixes.    \tsrowdLike \trowd but for table style definitions.\additiveUsed in a character style definition ('\*'\csº''). Indicates that character style attributes are to be added to the current paragraph style attributes, rather than setting the paragraph attributes to only those defined in the character style definition.\sbasedonNDefines the number of the style on which the current style is based (the default is 222no style).\snextNDefines the next style associated with the current style; if omitted, the next style is the current style.\sautoupdAutomatically update styles.\shiddenStyle does not appear in the Styles drop-down list in the Style dialog box The hidden style property can only be accessed using Microsoft Visual Basic® for Applications.

The syntax for this group is '\*\keycode <keys>'' where <keys> are the characters used in the key code. For example, a style, Normal, may be defined \s0 \*\keycode \shift\ctrl nNormal; within the RTF style sheet. See the Special Character control words for the characters outside the alphanumeric range that may be used.\altThe alt modifier key. Used to describe shortcut key codes for styles.\shiftThe shift modifier key. Used to describe shortcut key codes for styles.\ctrlThe ctrl modifier key. Used to describe shortcut key codes for styles.\fnNSpecifies a function key where N is the function key number. Used to describe shortcut-key codes for styles.
Table Styles
Word 2002 introduced table styles. Table styles are like other styles in that they contain properties to be shared by many tables. Unlike other styles, table styles allow for conditional formatting, such as specifically coloring the first row.  
To address the issue of older readers opening newer RTF files, raw properties were implemented. Older readers can still see the regular properties and edit them, but newer readers should be able to read the RTF back in and not lose any style functionality. This leaves two types of properties, those applied by older emitters that are readable by older readers, and those the user applied directly to override aspects of the style. The user-applied changes are referred to as raw and have a higher priority than their non-raw counterparts. 
The following table describes keywords available for style definitions. Any older table formatting properties may be used as well.

I used a style I called UNDERLINE.\par 
Some of the control words in this example are discussed in later sections. In the example, note that the properties of the style were emitted following the application of the style. This was done for two reasons: (1) to allow RTF readers that dont support styles to still retain all formatting; and (2) to allow the additive model for styles, where additional property changes are added on top of the defined style. Some RTF readers may not apply a style upon only encountering the style number without the accompanying formatting information because of this.
List Tables
Word 97, Word 2000, and Word 2002 store bullets and numbering information very differently from earlier versions of Word. In Word 6.0, for example, number formatting data is stored individually with each paragraph. In Word 97 and later versions, however, all of the formatting information is stored in a pair of document-wide list tables that act as a style sheet, and each individual paragraph stores only an index to one of the tables, like a style index.
There are two list tables in Word: the List table (destination \listtable), and the List Override table (destination \listoverridetable).
List Table
The first table Word stores is the List table. A List table is a list of lists (destination \list). Each list contains a number of list properties that pertain to the entire list, and a list of levels (destination \listlevel), each of which contains properties that pertain only to that level. The \listpicture destination contains all of the picture bullets used in the document, with a \shppict headed list of \pict entries. These are referenced within the list by the \levelpictureN keyword, with N referring to an element in the list, starting at 0.
The syntax for the List table is as follows:
<listtable> \*\listtable <listpicture>? <list>+ <listpicture> \*\listpicture <shppictlist> <list>\list \listemplateid & (\listsimple | listhybrid)? & <listlevel>+ & \listrestarthdn & \listid & (\listname #PCDATA ;) \liststyleid? \liststylename?<listlevel><number> <justification> & \leveljcnN? & \levelstartatN & (\leveloldN & \levelprevN? & \levelprevspaceN? & \levelspaceN? & \levelindentN?)? & <leveltext> & <levelnumbers> & \levelfollowN & \levellegalN? & \levelnorestartN? & <chrfmt>? & \levelpictureN & \li? & \fi? & (\jclisttab \tx)?<number>\levelnfcN | \levelnfcnN | (\levelnfcN & \levelnfcnN)<justification>\leveljcN | \leveljcnN | (\leveljcN & \leveljcnN)<leveltext> \leveltext \leveltemplateid? #SDATA ';' ''<levelnumbers> \levelnumbers #SDATA ';' ''
Top-Level List Properties
Control wordMeaning\listidNEach list must have a unique list ID that should be randomly generated. The value N is a long integer. The list ID cannot be between 1 and 5. \listtemplateidNEach list should have a unique template ID as well, which also should be randomly generated. The template ID cannot be 1. The value N is a long integer. \listsimpleN1 if the list has one level; 0 (default) if the list has nine levels.\listhybridPresent if the list has 9 levels, each of which is the equivalent of a simple list. Only one of \listsimple and \listhybrid should be present. Word 2000 will write lists with the \listhybrid property.\listrestarthdnN1 if the list restarts at each section; 0 if not. Used for Word 7.0 compatibility only. \listnameThe argument for \listname is a string that is the name of this list. Names allow ListNum fields to specify the list they belong to. This is a destination control word.\liststyleidNThis identifies the style of this list from the list style definition that has this ID as its \listid. There can be more than one list style reference to a list style definition. This keyword follows the same numbering convention as \listid.
\liststyleidN and \liststylename are exclusive; either zero or one of each can exist per \list definition, but never both.\liststylenameIdentifies this list as a list style definition. This creates a new list style with the given name and the properties of the current list.
\liststyleidN and \liststylename are exclusive; either zero or one of each can exist per \list definition, but never both.While Word 97 emitted simple or multilevel (not simple) lists, Word 2000 and Word 2002 emit hybrid lists, which are essentially collections of simple lists. The main difference between Word 2000 and Word 2002 hybrid lists and Word 97 multilevel lists is that each level of a hybrid list has a unique identifier.

List Levels
Each list consists of either one or nine list levels depending upon whether the \listsimple flag is set. Each list level contains a number of properties that specify the formatting for that level, such as the start-at value, the text string surrounding the number, its justification and indents, and so on.

Control wordMeaning\levelstartatNN specifies the start-at value for the level.\levelnfcNSpecifies the number type for the level:

2Right justified\levelnfcnNSame arguments as \levelnfc. Takes priority over \levelnfc if both are present. In Word 97 \levelnfc was interpreted differently by the Hebrew/Arabic versions.  \levelnfcnN in Word 2000 and Word 2002 eliminates dual interpretation, while \levelnfc is still needed for backward compatibility.\leveljcnNLeft justified for left-to-right paragraphs and right justified for right-to-left paragraphs
1Center justified
2Right justified for left-to-right paragraphs and left justified for right-to-left paragraphs
Word 2000 and Word 2002 prefer \leveljcnN over \leveljc if both are present, but it will be written for backward compatibility with older readers.\leveloldN1 if this level was converted from Word 6.0 or Word 7.0; 0 if it is a native Word 97 through Word 2002 level.\levelprevN1 if this level includes the text from the previous level (used for Word 7.0 compatibility only); otherwise, the value is 0. This keyword will only be valid if the \leveloldN keyword is emitted.\levelprevspaceN1 if this level includes the indentation from the previous level (used for Word 7.0 compatibility only); otherwise, the value is 0. This keyword will only be valid if the \leveloldN keyword is emitted.\levelindentNMinimum distance from the left indent to the start of the paragraph text (used for Word 7.0 compatibility only). This keyword will only be valid if the \leveloldN keyword is emitted.\levelspaceNMinimum distance from the right edge of the number to the start of the paragraph text (used for Word 7.0 compatibility only). This keyword will only be valid if the \leveloldN keyword is emitted.\leveltextIf the list is hybrid, as indicated by \listhybrid, the \leveltemplateidN keyword will be included, whose argument is a unique level ID that should be randomly generated. The value N is a long integer. The level ID cannot be between 1 and 5.
The second argument for this destination should be the number format string for this level. The first character is the length of the string, and any numbers within the level should be replaced by the index of the level they represent. For example, a level three number such as 1.1.1. would generate the following RTF: \leveltext \leveltemplateidN \'06\'00.\'01.\'02. where the 06 is the string length, the \00, \01, and \02 are the level placeholders, and the periods are the surrounding text. This is a destination control word.\levelnumbersThe argument for this destination should be a string that gives the offsets into the \leveltext of the level placeholders. In the preceding example, 1.1.1., the \levelnumbers RTF should be
\levelnumbers \01\03\05
because the level placeholders have indices 1, 3, and 5. This is a destination control word.\levelfollowNSpecifies which character follows the level text:  
Tab
1Space
2Nothing\levellegalN1 if any list numbers from previous levels should be converted to Arabic numbers; 0 if they should be left with the format specified by their own levels definition.\levelnorestartN1 if this level does not restart its count each time a number of a higher level is reached; 0 if this level does restart its count each time a number of a higher level is reached.\levelpictureNDetermines which picture bullet from the \listpicture destination should be applied.
In addition to all of these properties, each list level can contain any character properties (all of which affect all text for that level) and any combination of three paragraph properties: left indents, first line left indents, and tabseach of which must be of a special type: jclisttab. These paragraph properties will be automatically applied to any paragraph in the list.
List Override Table
The List Override table is a list of list overrides (destination \listoverride). Each list override contains the listid of one of the lists in the List table, as well as a list of any properties it chooses to override. Each paragraph will contain a list override index (keyword ls), which is a 1-based index into this table. Most list overrides dont override any propertiesinstead, they provide a level of indirection to a list. There are generally two types of list overrides: (1) formatting overrides, which allow a paragraph to be part of a list and are numbered along with the other members of the list, but have different formatting properties; and (2) start-at overrides, which allow a paragraph to share the formatting properties of a list, but have different start-at values. The first element in the document with each list override index takes the start-at value that the list override specifies as its value, while each subsequent element is assigned the number succeeding the previous element of the list.

List overrides have a few top-level keywords, including a \listoverridecount, which contains a count of the number of levels whose format is overridden. This \listoverridecount should always be either 1 or 9, depending upon whether the list to be overridden is simple or hybrid/multilevel. All of the actual override information is stored within a list of list override levels (destination \lfolevel).
Control wordMeaning\listidNShould exactly match the \listid of one of the lists in the List table. The value N is a long integer.\listoverridecountNNumber of list override levels within this list override (1 or 9).\lsThe (1-based) index of this \listoverride in the \listoverride table. This value should never be zero inside a \listoverride and must be unique for all \listoverrides within a document. The valid values are from 1 to 2000.
List Override Level
Each list override level contains flags to specify whether the formatting or start-at values are being overridden for each level. If the format flag (listoverrideformat) is given, the lfolevel should also contain a list level (listlevel). If the start-at flag (listoverridestartat) is given, a start-at value must be provided. If the start-at is overridden but the format is not, then a levelstartat should be provided in the lfolevel itself. If both start-at and format are overridden, put the levelstartat inside the listlevel contained in the lfolevel.

Control wordMeaning\listoverridestartatIndicates an override of the start-at value.\listoverrideformatNNumber of list override levels within this list override (should be either 1 or 9).Paragraph Group Properties
Word 2002 introduced paragraph group properties, similar to style sheets. A document making use of these places a \pgptbl entry in the header. Elements in the Paragraph Group Properties (PGP) table are entered as they are created in the document. In the program, the \ipgpN values are assigned random numbers, but for storage the numbers are converted to numbers in the integer range. Internally, this numbering system is left up to the developer. The formatting options are taken from the regular paragraph formatting options. PGP table entries may exist with different \ipgpN values but with the same properties. Any paragraph that references an entry in the PGP table does so by emitting \ipgpN, which sets paragraph formatting options according to the entry in the PGP table.  Additional formatting options may also be employed.
The PGP syntax is as follows:
<pgptbl> \*\pgptbl <entry>+  <entry> \pgp<value> <value>\ipgpN<parfmt>+
The following is a sample PGP table with two entries:
\*\pgptbl \pgp\ipgp13\itap0\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0\pgp\ipgp80\itap0\li720\ri0\sb100\sa100
Track Changes (Revision Marks)
This table allows tracking of multiple authors and reviewers of a document, and is used in conjunction with the character properties for tracking changes (using revision marks).

Control wordMeaning\*\revtblThis group consists of subgroups that each identify the author of a revision in the document, as in Author1;. This is a destination control word.
Revision conflicts, such as those that result when one author deletes another's additions, are stored as one group, in the following form:
CurrentAuthor\'00\'<length of previous author's name>PreviousAuthor\'00PreviousRevisionTime
The 4 bytes of the Date/Time (DTTM) structure are emitted as ASCII characters, so values greater than 127 should be emitted as hexadecimal values enclosed in quotation marks.
All time references for revision marks use the following bit field structure, DTTM.
Bit numbersInformationRange5Minute59610Hour231115Day of month1311619Month1122028Year= Year - 19002931Day of week0 (Sun)6 (Sat)
RSID
In Word 2002, a new style of revision tracking was established. RSIDs (Revision Save IDs) indicate when text or a property was changed. Whenever text is added or deleted or properties are changed, that text or property is tagged with the current "Save ID," which is a random number that changes each time the document is saved. They are primarily used when merging or comparing two documents with a common history but no revision marks. By looking at the RSID we can tell which of the two authors made the change. Without the RSID we can only tell that there is a difference, but we don't know if (for example) it was an addition by author A or a deletion by author B. An RSID table is placed after all other style definitions and before the <generator> and <info> groups.
The syntax for an RSID table is as follows:
<rsidtable> \*\rsidtbl <rsidlist>+ ; <rsidlist>\rsidN
Control wordMeaning\rsidNEach time a document is saved a new entry is added to this table, with N being the random number assigned to represent the unique session.\insrsidNAn RSID is inserted to denote the session in which particular text was inserted. Example:

With tracking enabled, changes to formatting can be documented. To keep track of the property before the changes were made, Old Properties were created.  This tracking uses the following syntax:
<oldprop> \*\<oldproptype> <oldproperties>+ <trackinginfo> ; <oldproptype>\oldcprops | \oldpprops | \oldtprops | \oldsprops<oldproperties>This section includes any of the relevant format tags that would have to be put in place to revert the document to its pre-edit form. For example, this would be \b0 if the user had chosen to make the selection bold.<trackinginfo>This can be any tag used to track the author, revision ID, and date.
Control wordMeaning\oldcpropsOld character formatting properties.\oldppropsOld paragraph formatting properties.\oldtpropsOld table formatting properties.\oldspropsOld section formatting properties.

The following is an example of the correct use of the Old Properties when bold and italics are applied to a section of existing text.  If the original text This is a test. is changed to This is a test. the following code snippet will be formed, which would tell an RTF reader that to undo the change to the character property bold and italic would have to be disabled:
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid2778197 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This \rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\i\crauth1\crdate1717000906\insrsid2778197\charrsid2778197 \*\oldcprops \b0\i0\crauth1\crdate1717000906\insrsid2778197\charrsid2778197 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 is a\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid2778197 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  test.\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid15803535
Generator
Word 2002 allows the RTF emitter application to stamp the document with its name, version, and build number. The generator area has the following syntax:
<generator> \*\generator <name> ; <name>#PCDATA, the name of the program, the version, the build, and any other information about the emitting program can be listed here. Word 2002 lists \*\generator Microsoft Word 10.0.XXXX in which XXXX is replaced by the build number. Only ASCII text is allowed in this field.Document Area
Once the RTF header is defined, the RTF reader has enough information to correctly read the actual document text. The document area has the following syntax:
<document><info>? <docfmt>* <section>+Information Group
The \info control word introduces the information group, which contains information about the document. This can include the title, author, keywords, comments, and other information specific to the file. This information is for use by a document-management utility, if available.
The information group has the following syntax:
<info>'' <title>? & <subject>? & <author>? & <manager>? & <company>? <operator>? & <category>? & <keywords>? & <comment>? & \version? & <doccomm>? & \vern? & <creatim>? & <revtim>? & <printim>? & <buptim>? & \edmins? & \nofpages? & \nofwords? \nofchars? & \id? ''<title>'' \title #PCDATA ''<subject>'' \subject #PCDATA ''<author>'' \author #PCDATA ''<manager>' \manager #PCDATA ''<company>' \company #PCDATA ''<operator>'' \operator #PCDATA ''<category>' \category #PCDATA ''<keywords>'' \keywords #PCDATA ''<comment>'' \comment #PCDATA ''<doccomm>'' \doccomm #PCDATA ''<hlinkbase>'' \hlinkbase #PCDATA ''<creatim>'' \creatim <time> ''<revtim>'' \revtim <time> ''<printim>'' \printim <time> ''<buptim>'' \buptim <time> ''<time>\yr? \mo? \dy? \hr? \min? \sec?
Some applications, such as Word, ask the user to type this information when saving the document in its native format. If the document is then saved as an RTF file or translated into RTF, the RTF writer specifies this information using control words in the following table. These control words are destinations, and both the control words and the text should be enclosed in braces ( ).
Control wordMeaning\titleTitle of the document. This is a destination control word.\subjectSubject of the document. This is a destination control word.\authorAuthor of the document. This is a destination control word.\managerManager of the author. This is a destination control word.\companyCompany of the author. This is a destination control word.\operatorPerson who last made changes to the document. This is a destination control word.\categoryCategory of the document. This is a destination control word.\keywordsSelected keywords for the document. This is a destination control word.\commentComments; text is ignored. This is a destination control word.\versionNVersion number of the document.\doccommComments displayed in the Summary Info or Properties dialog box in Word. This is a destination control word.\hlinkbaseThe base address that is used for the path of all relative hyperlinks inserted in the document. This can be a path or an Internet address (URL). 
The \userprops control word introduces the user-defined document properties. Unique \propname control words define each user-defined property in the document. This group has the following syntax:
<userprops>\* \userprops ( <propinfo> *) <propinfo><propname> <proptype> <staticval> <linkval>?<propname>  \propname #PCDATA <proptype>\proptype<staticval>\staticval<linkval>\linkval
Control wordMeaning\propnameThe name of the user-defined property.\staticvalThe value of the property.\linkvalThe name of a bookmark that contains the text to display as the value of the property.\proptypeNSpecifies the type of the property:
3Integer
5Real number
7Date
11Boolean
30Text
The RTF writer may automatically enter other control words, including those in the following table.
Control wordMeaning\vernNInternal version number\creatimCreation time\revtimRevision time\printimLast print time\buptimBackup time\edminsNTotal editing time (in minutes)\yrNYear\moNMonth\dyNDay\hrNHour\minNMinute\secNSeconds\nofpagesNNumber of pages\nofwordsNNumber of words\nofcharsNNumber of characters including spaces\nofcharswsNNumber of characters not including spaces\idNInternal ID number
Any control word described in the previous table that does not have a numeric parameter specifies a date; all dates are specified with the \yr \mo \dy \hr \min \sec controls. An example of an information group follows:
\info\title Template\author John Doe\operator JOHN DOE\creatim\yr1999\mo4\dy27\min1\revtim\yr1999\mo4\dy27\min1\printim\yr1999\mo3\dy17\hr23\min5\version2\edmins2\nofpages183\nofwords53170\nofchars303071\*\company Microsoft\nofcharsws372192\vern8247
Document Formatting Properties
After the information group (if there is one), there may be some document formatting control words (described as <docfmt> in the document area syntax description). These control words specify the attributes of the document, such as margins and footnote placement. These attributes must precede the first plain-text character in the document.
The control words that specify document formatting are listed in the following table (measurements are in twips; a twip is one-twentieth of a point). For omitted control words, RTF uses the default values.
Note that the three document-protection control words (\formprot, \revprot, and \annotprot) are mutually exclusive; only one of the three can apply to any given document. Also, there is currently no method for storing passwords in RTF, so any document that associates a password with a protection level will lose the password protection in RTF.
For more information about bidirectional controls, see Bidirectional Language Support in this specification.

Section Text
Each section in the RTF file has the following syntax:
<section> <secfmt>* <hdrftr>? <para>+ (\sect <section>)?Section Formatting Properties
At the beginning of each section, there may be some section-formatting control words (described as <secfmt> in the section text syntax description). These control words specify section-formatting properties, which apply to the text following the control word, with the exception of the section-break control words (those beginning with \sbk). Section-break control words describe the break preceding the text. These control words can appear anywhere in the section, not just at the start.
Note that if the \sectd control word is not present, the current section inherits all section properties defined in the previous section.
The section-formatting control words are listed in the following table.
Control wordMeaning\sectNew section.\sectdReset to default section properties.\endnhereEndnotes included in the section.\binfsxnNN is the printer bin used for the first page of the section. If this control is not defined, then the first page uses the same printer bin as defined by the \binsxnN control.\binsxnNN is the printer bin used for the pages of the section.\dsNDesignates section style. If a section style is specified, style properties must be specified with the section.\pnseclvlNUsed for multilevel lists. This property sets the default numbering style for each corresponding \pnlvlN control word (bullets and numbering property for paragraphs) within that section. This is a destination control word.\sectunlockedThis section is unlocked for forms.Section Break\sbknoneNo section break.\sbkcolSection break starts a new column.\sbkpageSection break starts a new page (the default).\sbkevenSection break starts at an even page.\sbkoddSection break starts at an odd page.Columns\colsNNumber of columns for "snaking" (the default is 1).\colsxNSpace between columns in twips (the default is 720).\colnoN Column number to be formatted; used to specify formatting for variable-width columns.\colsrN Space to right of column in twips; used to specify formatting for variable-width columns.\colwN Width of column in twips; used to override the default constant width setting for variable-width columns.\linebetcolLine between columns.Footnotes and Endnotes\sftntjFootnotes beneath text (top justified).\sftnbjFootnotes at the bottom of the page (bottom justified).\sftnstartNBeginning footnote number (the default is 1).\saftnstartNBeginning endnote number (the default is 1).\sftnrstpgRestart footnote numbering each page.\sftnrestartFootnote numbers restart at each section.

Headers and Footers
Headers and footers are RTF destinations. Each section in the document can have its own set of headers and footers. If no headers or footers are defined for a given section, the headers and footers from the previous section (if any) are used. Headers and footers have the following syntax:
<hdrftr>'' <hdrctl> <para>+ '' <hdrftr>?<hdrctl>\header | \footer | \headerl | \headerr | \headerf | \footerl | \footerr | \footerfNote that each separate <hdrftr> group must have a distinct <hdrctl> introducing it.
Control wordMeaning\headerHeader on all pages. This is a destination control word.\footerFooter on all pages. This is a destination control word.\headerlHeader on left pages only. This is a destination control word.\headerrHeader on right pages only. This is a destination control word.\headerfHeader on first page only. This is a destination control word.\footerlFooter on left pages only. This is a destination control word.\footerrFooter on right pages only. This is a destination control word.\footerfFooter on first page only. This is a destination control word.
The \headerl, \headerr, \footerl, and \footerr control words are used in conjunction with the \facingp control word, and the \headerf and \footerf control words are used in conjunction with the \titlepg control word. Many RTF readers will not function correctly if the appropriate document properties are not set. In particular, if \facingp is not set, then only \header and \footer should be used; if \facingp is set, then only \headerl, \headerr, \footerl, and \footerr should be used. Combining both \facingp and \titlepg is allowed. You should not use \header to set the headers for both pages when \facingp is set. You can use \headerf if \titlepg is not set, but no header will appear. For more information, see Document Formatting Properties and Section Formatting Properties in this Specification.
If the previous section had a first page header or footer and had \titlepg set, and the current section does not, then the previous section's first page header or footer is disabled. However, it is not destroyed; if subsequent sections have \titlepg set, then the first page header or footer is restored.
Paragraph Text
There are two kinds of paragraphs: plain and table. A table is a collection of paragraphs, and a table row is a continuous sequence of paragraphs partitioned into cells. The \intbl paragraph-formatting control word identifies the paragraph as part of a table. Additional keywords related to table styles are documented next, and refer to properties of the cell within which the paragraph resides. For more information, see the Table Definitions section of this Specification.  This control is inherited between paragraphs that do not have paragraph properties reset with \pard.

These control words (described as <parfmt> in the paragraph-text syntax description) specify generic paragraph formatting properties. These control words can appear anywhere in the body of the paragraph, not just at the beginning.
Note that if the \pard control word is not present, the current paragraph inherits all paragraph properties defined in the previous paragraph.
The paragraph-formatting control words are listed in the following table.
Control wordMeaning\parNew paragraph.\ pardResets to default paragraph properties.\spvStyle separator feature that causes the paragraph mark to not appear even in ShowAll. Used to nest paragraphs within the document view or outline without generating a new heading.\hyphparToggles automatic hyphenation for the paragraph.

This is a paragraph property used to override the absence of the document-level \widowctrl.\outlinelevelNOutline level of paragraph. The N argument is a value from 0 to 8 representing the outline level of the paragraph. In the default case, no outline level is specified (same as body text).  \pagebbBreak page before the paragraph.\sbysSide-by-side paragraphs.\sNDesignates paragraph style. If a paragraph style is specified, style properties must be specified with the paragraph.

Word 6.0 and Word 95 RTF
To provide compatibility with existing RTF readers, all applications that can automatically format paragraphs with bullets or numbers will also emit the generated text as plain text in the \pntext group. This will allow existing RTF readers to capture the plain text and safely ignore the auto number instructions. This group precedes all bulleted or numbered paragraphs, and will contain all the text and formatting that would be automatically generated. It should precede the ''\*\pn º '' destination, and it is the responsibility of RTF readers that understand the ''\*\pn º '' destination to ignore the \pntext group.  The following table defines the grammar of this group.

Word 97 through Word 2002 RTF
Each paragraph that is part of a list must contain some keyword to indicate which list its in, and which level of the list it belongs to. Word 97 through Word 2002 also provide the flat text representation of each number (in the \listtext destination); so, RTF readers that dont understand Word 97 numbering will get the paragraph number, along with appropriate character properties, inserted into their document at the beginning of the paragraph. Any RTF reader that does understand Word 97 through Word 2002 numbering should ignore the entire \listtext destination.
Control wordMeaning\lsShould exactly match the ls for one of the list overrides in the List Override table.\ilvlThe 0-based level of the list to which the paragraph belongs. For all simple lists, this should always be 0. For multilevel lists, it can be 0 through 8.\listtextContains the flat text representation of the number, including character properties. Should be ignored by any reader that understands Word 97 through Word 2002 numbering. This is a destination control word.
Revision Marks for Paragraph Numbers and ListNum Fields
Paragraph numbers and ListNum fields track revision information with special properties applied to the paragraph mark and ListNum field, respectively. The special properties hold the "old" value of the numberthe value it held when revision-mark tracking began. At display time, Word checks the number's current value and compares it with this "old" value to determine whether it has changed. If the numbers are different, the old value shows up as deleted and the new value as inserted; if the numbers are the same, Word displays the new value normally, with no revision information. If there was no old value, the new value shows up as inserted. The following table lists the RTF specifications for these special properties.
Control wordMeaning\pnrauthNIndex into the revision table. The content of the Nth group in the revision table is considered to be the author of that revision. 
Note This keyword is used to indicate paragraph number revisions.\pnrdateNTime of the revision. The 32-bit DTTM structure is emitted as a long integer.\pnrnotIndicates whether the paragraph number for the current paragraph is marked as "inserted."\pnrxstNThe keywords \pnrxst, \pnrrgb, \pnrpnbr, and \pnrnfc describe the "deleted number" text for the paragraph number. Their values are binary. Each of these keywords is represented as an array. The deleted number is written out with a \pnrstart keyword, followed by the arrays keyword, followed by the first byte of the array, followed by the arrays keyword, followed by the second byte of the arrays keyword, followed by the arrays keyword, followed by the third byte of the arrays keyword, and so on. This sequence is followed by the \pnrstop keyword.

The number format code is represented as a short integer. \pnrpnbrNNine-item array of the actual values of the number in each level. The number is represented as a long integer.\pnrstartNThe \pnrxst, \pnrrgb, \pnrpnbr, and \pnrnfc arrays are each preceded by the \pnrstart keyword, whose argument is 0 through 3, depending on the array.\pnrstopNThe \pnrxst, \pnrrgb, \pnrpnbr, and \pnrnfc arrays are each terminated by the \pnrstop keyword, whose argument is the number of bytes written out in the array.
Example
Lets take an example of the number "3-4b." which represents the third level of the list. The following table lists the values of each array.

The following paragraph-formatting control words specify the location of a paragraph on the page. Consecutive paragraphs with the same frame formatting are considered part of the same frame. For two framed paragraphs to appear at the same position on a page, they must be separated by a paragraph with different or no frame information.
Note that if any paragraph in a table row has any of these control words specified, then all paragraphs in the table row must have the same control words specified, either by inheriting the properties from the previous paragraph or by re-specifying the controls.
Paragraph positioning has the following syntax:
<apoctl><framesize> & <horzpos> & <vertpos> & <txtwrap> & <dropcap> & <txtflow> & \absnoovrlp?<framesize>\absw? & \absh?<horzpos><hframe> & <hdist><vertpos><vframe> & <vdist><txtwrap>\nowrap? & \dxfrtext? & \dfrmtxtx? &\dfrmtxty?<dropcap>\dropcapli? & \dropcapt?<hframe>\phmrg? | \phpg? | \phcol?<hdist>\posx? | \posnegx? | \posxc? | \posxi? | \posxo? | \posxl? | \posxr?<vframe>\pvmrg? | \pvpg? | \pvpara?<vdist>\posy? | \posnegy? | \posyt? | \posyil? | \posyb? | \posyc? | \posyin? | \posyout? & \abslock?<txtflow>\frmtxlrtb | \frmtxtbrl | \frmtxbtlr | \frmtxlrtbv | \frmtxtbrlv
Control wordMeaningFrame Size\abswNN is the width of the frame in twips. \abshNN is the height of the frame in twips. A positive number indicates the minimum height of the frame, and a negative number indicates the exact height of the frame.

Table Definitions
There is no RTF table group; instead, tables are specified as paragraph properties. A table is represented as a sequence of table rows. A table row is a continuous sequence of paragraphs partitioned into cells. The table row begins with the \trowd control word and ends with the \row control word. Every paragraph that is contained in a table row must have the \intbl control word specified or inherited from the previous paragraph. A cell may have more than one paragraph in it; the cell is terminated by a cell mark (the \cell control word), and the row is terminated by a row mark (the \row control word). Table rows can also be positioned. In this case, every paragraph in a table row must have the same positioning controls (see the <apoctl> controls on the Positioned Objects and Frames subsection of this Specification. Table properties may be inherited from the previous row; therefore, a series of table rows may be introduced by a single <tbldef>.
An RTF table row has the following syntax, as shown in the general paragraph-text syntax shown in the Paragraph Text section of this Specification:
<row>(<tbldef> <cell>+ <tbldef> \row) | (<tbldef> <cell>+ \row) | (<cell>+ <tbldef> \row)<cell>(<nestrow>? <tbldef>?) & <textpar>+ \cell<nestrow><nestcell>+ \*\nesttableprops <tbldef> \nestrow <nestcell><textpar>+ \nestcell
Note that while Word 97 emitted the row properties (<tbldef>) at the beginning of the row, a reader should not assume that this is the case. Properties can be emitted at the end, and, in fact, Word 2002 does this. To avoid breaking readers that might make the aforementioned assumption, Word 2002 will write a copy at the beginning as well, so the properties of a typical row in a Word 2002 document are repeated at the beginning and at the end of the row. Note that for nested cells, Word 2002 writes the properties at the end only.

A table definition has the following syntax:
<tbldef>\trowd \irowN \irowbandN \tsN \trgaph & <rowjust>? & <rowwrite>? & <rowtop>? & <rowbot>? & <rowleft>? & <rowright>? & <rowhor>? & <rowvert>? & <rowpos> ? & \trleft? & \trrh? \trhdr? & \trkeep? & <rowwidth>? & <rowinv>? & \trautofit? & <rowspc>? & <rowpad>? & \taprtl? <trrevision>? <tflags>? <celldef>+<rowjust> \trql | \trqr | \trqc <rowwrite>\ltrrow | \rtlrow<rowtop>\trbrdrt <brdr><rowbot>\trbrdrl <brdr><rowleft>\trbrdrb <brdr><rowright>\trbrdrr <brdr><rowhor>\trbrdrh <brdr><rowvert>\trbrdrv <brdr><rowpos><rowhorzpos> & <rowvertpos> & <rowwrap> & \tabsnoovrlp?<rowhorzpos><rowhframe>& <rowhdist><rowvertpos><rowvframe>& <rowvdist><rowwrap>\tdfrmtxtLeft? & \tdfrmtxtRight? & \tdfrmtxtTop? & \tdfrmtxtBottom?<rowhframe>\phmrg? | \phpg? | \phcol?<rowhdist>\tposx? | \tposnegx? | \tposxc? | \tposxi? | \tposxo? | \tposxl? | \tposxr?<rowvframe>\tpvmrg? | \tpvpg? | \tpvpara?<rowvdist>\tposy? | \tposnegy? | \tposyt? | \tposyil? | \tposyb? | \tposyc? | tposyin  | tposyout <rowwidth>\trftsWidth & \trwWidth?<rowinv>(\trftsWidthB & \trwWidthB?)? & (\trftsWidthA & \trwWidthA?)?<rowspc>(\trspdl & \trspdfl?)? & (\trspdt & \trspdft?)? & (\trspdb & \trspdfb?)? & (\trspdr & \trspdfr?)?<rowpad>(\trpaddl & \trpaddfl?)? & (\trpaddt & \trpaddft?)? & (\trpaddb & \trpaddfb?)? & (\trpaddr & \trpaddfr?)?<trrevision>\trauthN \trdateN<tflags>\tbllkborder & \tbllkshading  & \tbllkfont & \tbllkcolor & \tbllkbestfit & \tbllkhdrrows & \tbllklastrow & \tbllkhdrcols & \tbllklastcol<celldef>(\clmgf? & \clmrg? & \clvmgf? & \clvmrg? <celldgu>? & <celldgl>? & <cellalign>? & <celltop>? & <cellleft>? & <cellbot>? & <cellright>? & <cellshad>? & <cellflow>? & clFitText? & clNoWrap? & <cellwidth>? & <cellpad>?) \cellx<celldgu>\cldglu <brdr><celldgl>\cldgll <brdr><cellalign>\clvertalt | \clvertalc | \clvertalb<celltop>\clbrdrt <brdr><cellleft>\clbrdrl <brdr><cellbot>\clbrdrb <brdr><cellright>\clbrdrr <brdr><cellshad><cellpat>? \clcfpat? & \clcbpat? & \clshdng <cellpat>\clbghoriz | \clbgvert | \clbgfdiag | \clbgbdiag | \clbgcross | \clbgdcross | \clbgdkhor | \clbgdkvert | \clbgdkfdiag | \clbgdkbdiag | \clbgdkcross | \clbgdkdcross <cellflow>\cltxlrtb | \cltxtbrl | \cltxbtlr | \cltxlrtbv | \cltxtbrlv<cellwidth>\clftsWidth & \clwWidth?<cellpad>(\clpadl & \clpadfl?)? & (\clpadt & \clpadft?)? & (\clpadb & \clpadfb?)? & (\clpadr & \clpadfr?)?

Example
The following is an example of a complex Word 2000 table RTF. It does not take account of the table styles implemented in Word 2002. The BMP showing the tables look and position is followed by the corresponding RTF, which is followed by a piece-by-piece analysis of the RTF.

The image shows a freely positioned Word table, with two cells at an offset. Inside the topmost cell is a nested table. The table has green borders, yellow shading, a small amount of spacing between cells, and inner cell margins or padding.

Character Text
Character text has the following syntax:
<char><ptext> | <atext> | '' <char> ''<ptext>(<chrfmt>* <data>+ )+<data>#PCDATA | <spec> | <pict> | <obj> | <do> | <foot> | <annot> | <field> | <idx> | <toc> | <book>Font (Character) Formatting Properties
These control words (described as <chrfmt> in the syntax description) change font (character) formatting properties. A control word preceding plain text turns on the specified attribute. Some control words (indicated in the following table by an asterisk following the description) can be turned off by appending 0 to the control word. For example, \b turns on bold, while \b0 turns off bold.
The font (character) formatting control words are listed in the following table.

To read negative \expnd values from Word for the Macintosh, an RTF reader should use only the low-order 6 bits of the value read. Word for the Macintosh does not emit negative values for \expnd. Instead, it treats values from 57 through 63 as 7 through 1, respectively (the low-order 6 bits of 57 through 63 are the same as 7 through 1).
Character Borders and Shading
Character shading has the following syntax:
<shading>(\chshdng | <pat>) \chcfpat? \chcbpat?<pat>\chbghoriz | \chbgvert | \chbgfdiag | \chbgbdiag | \chbgcross | \chbgdcross | \chbgdkhoriz | \chbgdkvert | \chbgdkfdiag | \chbgdkbdiag | \chbgdkcross | \chbgdkdcross

Bidirectional-aware text processors often need to associate a Latin (or other left-to-right) font with an Arabic or Hebrew (or other right-to-left) font. The association is needed to match commonly used pairs of fonts in name, size, and other attributes. Although RTF defines a broad variety of associated character properties, any implementation may choose not to implement a particular associated character property and share the property between the Latin and Arabic fonts.
Property association uses the following syntax:
<atext><ltrrun> | <rtlrun><ltrrun>\rtlch \af & <aprops>* \ltrch <ptext><rtlrun>\ltrch \af & <aprops>* \rtlch <ptext><atext><losbrun> | <hisbrun> | <dbrun><losbrun>\hich \af & <aprops> \dbch \af & <aprops> \loch <ptext><hisbrun>\loch \af & <aprops> \dbch \af & <aprops> \hich <ptext><dbrun>\loch \af & <aprops> \hich \af & <aprops> \dbch <ptext>The following are some examples of property association. The first example is a right-to-left run. Text will use the default bidirectional font, and will be underlined. The left-to-right font associated with this run is font 2 (in the font table) with bold and underlining.
\ltrch\af2\ab\au\rtlch\u Sample Text
The next example is a left-to-right run. The right-to-left font and the left-to-right font use the default font (specified by \deff).
\plain\rtlch\ltrch Sample Text 
The following example is a left-to-right run. The right-to-left font is font 5, bold and italicized. The left-to-right font is the default font, underlined. If the reader does not support underlining in the associated font, both fonts will be underlined.
\rtlch\af5\ab\ai\ltrch\u Sample Text
The property association control words (described as <aprops> in the syntax description) are listed in the following table. Some control words (indicated in the table by an asterisk following the description) can be turned off by appending 0 to the control word.
Control wordMeaning\abAssociated font is bold.*\acapsAssociated font is all capitals.*\acfNAssociated foreground color (the default is 0).\adnNAssociated font is subscript position in half-points (the default is 6).\aexpndNExpansion or compression of the space between characters in quarter-points; a negative value compresses (the default is 0).\afNAssociated font number (the default is 0).\afsNAssociated font size in half-points (the default is 24).\aiAssociated font is italic.*\alangNLanguage ID for the associated font.

This property applies highlighting to text. The formatting is not a character format, so it cannot be part of a style definition.
Control wordMeaning\highlightNHighlights the specified text. N specifies the color as an index of the color table.Special Characters
The RTF Specification includes control words for special characters (described as <spec> in the character-text syntax description). If a special-character control word is not recognized by the RTF reader, it is ignored and the text following it is considered plain text. The RTF Specification is flexible enough to allow new special characters to be added for interchange with other software.
The special RTF characters are listed in the following table.
Control wordMeaning\chdateCurrent date (as in headers).\chdplCurrent date in long format (for example, Thursday, October 28, 1997).\chdpaCurrent date in abbreviated format (for example, Thu, Oct 28, 1997).\chtimeCurrent time (as in headers).\chpgnCurrent page number (as in headers).\sectnumCurrent section number (as in headers).\chftnAutomatic footnote reference (footnotes follow in a group).\chatnAnnotation reference (annotation text follows in a group).\chftnsepAnchoring character for footnote separator.\chftnsepcAnchoring character for footnote continuation.\cellEnd of table cell.\nestcellEnd of nested table cell.\rowEnd of table row.\nestrowEnd of nested table row.\parEnd of paragraph.\sectEnd of section and paragraph.\pageRequired page break.\columnRequired column break.\lineRequired line break (no paragraph break).\lbrNText wrapping break of type:

(Used by Word 5.1 for the Macintosh as the beginning delimiter for a string of formula typesetting commands.)\~Nonbreaking space.\-Optional hyphen.\_Nonbreaking hyphen.\:Specifies a subentry in an index entry.\*Marks a destination whose text should be ignored if not understood by the RTF reader.\'hhA hexadecimal value, based on the specified character set (may be used to identify 8-bit values).\ltrmarkThe following characters should be displayed from left to right; usually found at the start of \ltrch runs.\rtlmarkThe following characters should be displayed from right to left; usually found at the start of \rtlch runs.\zwboZero-width break opportunity. Used to insert break opportunity between two characters.\zwnboZero-width nonbreak opportunity. Used to remove break opportunity between two characters.\zwjZero-width joiner. This is used for ligating (joining) characters.\zwnjZero-width nonjoiner. This is used for unligating a character. 
A carriage return (character value 13) or linefeed (character value 10) will be treated as a \par control if the character is preceded by a backslash. You must include the backslash; otherwise, RTF ignores the control word. (You may also want to insert a carriage-return/linefeed pair without backslashes at least every 255 characters for better text transmission over communication lines.)
A tab (character value 9) should be treated as a \tab control word. Not all RTF readers understand this; therefore, an RTF writer should always emit the control word for tabs.
The following are the code values for the special characters listed.
Control wordWord for Windows and OS/2Apple Macintosh\bullet1490xA5\endash1500xD1\emdash1510xD0\lquote1450xD4\rquote1460xD5\ldblquote1470xD2\rdblquote1480xD3Document Variables
Document variables are definable and accessed through macros. Document variables have the following syntax:
<variables>\* <docvar> <varname>   <vartext>  *<docvar>\docvar <varname>#PCDATA<vartype>#PCDATA
The control word is described in the following table.
Control wordMeaning\ docvarA group that defines a document variable name and its value.Bookmarks
This destination may specify one of two control words: \*\bkmkstart, which indicates the start of the specified bookmark, and \*\bkmkend, which indicates the end of the specified bookmark.
Bookmarks have the following syntax:
<book><bookstart> | <bookend><bookstart>'\*' \bkmkstart (\bkmkcolf? & \bkmkcoll?) #PCDATA ''<bookend>'\*' \bkmkend #PCDATA ''
A bookmark is shown in the following example:
\pard\plain \fs20 Kuhn believes that science, rather than 
discovering in experience certain structured 
relationships, actually creates (or already participates in) 
a presupposed structure to which it fits the data. 
\bkmkstart paradigm Kuhn calls such a presupposed 
structure a paradigm.\bkmkend paradigm
The bookmark start and end are matched with the bookmark tag. In this example, the bookmark tag is "paradigm." Each bookmark start should have a matching bookmark end; however, the bookmark start and the bookmark end may be in any order.
\bkmkcolfN is used to denote the first column of a table covered by a bookmark. If it is not included, the first column is assumed. \bkmkcollN is used to denote the last column. If it is not used, the last column is assumed. These controls are used within the \*\bkmkstart destination following the \bkmkstart control. For example, \*\bkmkstart\bkmkcolf2\bkmkcoll5 Table1 places the bookmark "Table1" in columns 2 through 5 of a table.
Pictures
An RTF file can include pictures created with other applications. These pictures can be in hexadecimal (the default) or binary format. Pictures are destinations and begin with the \pict control word. The \pict keyword is preceded by the \*\shppict destination control keyword as described in the following example. A picture destination has the following syntax:
<pict>'' \pict (<brdr>? & <shading>? & <picttype> & <pictsize> & <metafileinfo>?) <data> ''<picttype>| \emfblip | \pngblip | \jpegblip | \macpict | \pmmetafile | \wmetafile | \dibitmap <bitmapinfo> | \wbitmap <bitmapinfo><bitmapinfo>\wbmbitspixel & \wbmplanes & \wbmwidthbytes<pictsize>(\picw & \pich) \picwgoal? & \pichgoal? \picscalex? & \picscaley? & \picscaled? & \piccropt? & \piccropb? & \piccropr? & \piccropl?<metafileinfo>\picbmp & \picbpp<data>(\bin #BDATA) | #SDATA
These control words are described in the following table. Some measurements in this table are in twips. A twip is one-twentieth of a point.
Control wordMeaning\emfblipSource of the picture is an EMF (enhanced metafile).\pngblipSource of the picture is a PNG.\jpegblipSource of the picture is a JPEG.\shppictSpecifies a Word 97 through Word 2002 picture. This is a destination control word.\nonshppictSpecifies that Word 97 through Word 2002 has written a \pict destination that it will not read on input. This keyword is for compatibility with other readers.\macpictSource of the picture is QuickDraw.\pmmetafileNSource of the picture is an OS/2 metafile. The N argument identifies the metafile type. The N values are described in the \pmmetafile table further on in this section.\wmetafileNSource of the picture is a Windows metafile. The N argument identifies the metafile type (the default type is 1).\dibitmapNSource of the picture is a Windows device-independent bitmap. The N argument identifies the bitmap type, which must equal 0.
The information to be included in RTF from a Windows device-independent bitmap is the concatenation of the BITMAPINFO structure followed by the actual pixel data.\wbitmapNSource of the picture is a Windows device-dependent bitmap. The N argument identifies the bitmap type (must equal 0).
The information to be included in RTF from a Windows device-dependent bitmap is the result of the GetBitmapBits function.The following is an example of the \shppict group:
\*\shppict \pict \emfblip ….. \nonshppict \pict ….
For best device-independence and interoperability with Microsoft products, use of the \wbitmap and \dibitmap control words is discouraged. Rather, bitmaps should be embedded within Windows metafiles and the \wmetafile control word should be used. For more information on the GetDIBits and GetBitmapBits functions and the structure of Windows device-independent and device-dependent bitmaps, as well as information on embedding bitmaps within metafiles, see Volume 1 and Volume 2 of the Programmer's Reference in the Microsoft Windows 3.1 Software Development Kit.  The following table outlines picture control keywords:
Control wordMeaningBitmap Information\wbmbitspixelNNumber of adjacent color bits on each plane needed to define a pixel. Possible values are 1 (monochrome), 4 (16 colors), 8 (256 colors) and 24 (RGB). The default value is 1.\wbmplanesNNumber of bitmap color planes (must equal 1).\wbmwidthbytesNSpecifies the number of bytes in each raster line. This value must be an even number because the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) assumes that the bit values of a bitmap form an array of integer (two-byte) values. In other words, \wbmwidthbytes multiplied by 8 must be the next multiple of 16 greater than or equal to the \picw (bitmap width in pixels) value.Picture Size, Scaling, and Cropping\picwNxExt field if the picture is a Windows metafile; picture width in pixels if the picture is a bitmap or from QuickDraw. The N argument is a long integer.\pichNyExt field if the picture is a Windows metafile; picture height in pixels if the picture is a bitmap or from QuickDraw. The N argument is a long integer.\picwgoalNDesired width of the picture in twips. The N argument is a long integer.\pichgoalNDesired height of the picture in twips. The N argument is a long integer.\picscalexNHorizontal scaling value. The N argument is a value representing a percentage (the default is 100 percent).\picscaleyNVertical scaling value. The N argument is a value representing a percentage (the default is 100 percent).\picscaledScales the picture to fit within the specified frame. Used only with \macpict pictures.\picpropIndicates there are shape properties applied to an inline picture. This is a destination control word.\defshpIndicates that the inline picture is a WordArt shape.\piccroptNTop cropping value in twips. A positive value crops toward the center of the picture; a negative value crops away from the center, adding a space border around the picture (the default value is 0).\piccropbNBottom cropping value in twips. A positive value crops toward the center of the picture; a negative value crops away from the center, adding a space border around the picture (the default value is 0).\piccroplNLeft cropping value in twips. A positive value crops toward the center of the picture; a negative value crops away from the center, adding a space border around the picture (the default value is 0).\piccroprNRight cropping value in twips. A positive value crops toward the center of the picture; a negative value crops away from the center, adding a space border around the picture (the default value is 0).Metafile Information\picbmpSpecifies whether a metafile contains a bitmap.\picbppNSpecifies the bits per pixel in a metafile bitmap. The valid range is 1 through 32, with 1, 4, 8, and 24 being recognized.Picture Data\binNThe picture is in binary format. The numeric parameter N is the number of bytes that follow. Unlike all other controls, this control word takes a 32-bit parameter.\blipupiNN represents units per inch on a picture (only certain image types need or output this)\blipuid XXXXXUsed as \*\blipuid XXXXX where XXXX is a 16-byte identification number for the image.\bliptagNA unique identifier for a picture, where N is a long integer value.
The \wbitmap control word is optional. If no other picture type is specified, the picture is assumed to be a Windows bitmap. If \wmetafile is specified, the N argument can be one of the following types.
TypeN argumentMM_TEXT1MM_LOMETRIC2MM_HIMETRIC3MM_LOENGLISH4MM_HIENGLISH5MM_TWIPS6MM_ISOTROPIC7MM_ANISOTROPIC8
For more information about these types, see volume 1 of the Programmers Reference in the Microsoft Windows 3.1 Software Development Kit.
If \pmmetafile is specified, the N argument can be one of the following types.
TypeN argumentPU_ARBITRARY0x0004PU_PELS0x0008PU_LOMETRIC0x000CPU_HIMETRIC0x0010PU_LOENGLISH0x0014PU_HIENGLISH0x0018PU_TWIPS0x001C
For more information about these types, see volume 2 of the OS/2 Programmers Reference.
Be careful with spaces following control words when dealing with pictures in binary format. When reading files, RTF considers the first space after a control word the delimiter and subsequent spaces part of the document text. Therefore, any extra spaces are attached to the picture, with unpredictable results.
RTF writers should not use the carriage return/line feed (CR/LF) combination to break up pictures in binary format. If they do, the CR/LF combination is treated as literal text and considered part of the picture data.
The picture in hexadecimal or binary format follows the picture-destination control words. The following example illustrates the destination format:
\pict\wbitmap0\picw170\pich77\wbmbitspixel1\wbmplanes1\wbmwidthbytes22

Objects
Microsoft OLE links, Microsoft OLE embedded objects, and Macintosh Edition Manager subscriber objects are represented in RTF as objects. Objects are destinations that contain data and a result. The data is generally hidden to the application that produced the document. A separate application uses the data and supplies the appearance of the data. This appearance is the result of the object.
The representation of objects in RTF is designed to allow RTF readers that don't understand objects, or don't use a particular type of object, to use the current result in place of the object. This allows the appearance of the object to be maintained through the conversion even though the object functionality is lost. Each object comes with optional information about itself, a required destination that contains the object data, and an optional result that contains the current appearance of the object. This result contains standard RTF. The RTF writer is responsible for providing the result so that existing RTF readers that either do not support objects, or that do not support a particular type of object, will be able to display the object.
When the object is an OLE embedded or linked object, the data part of the object is the structure produced by the OLESaveToStream function. Some OLE clients rely on the OLE system to render the object when a copy of the result is not available to the RTF writer for that application. In these cases, the object result can be extracted from the structure produced by the OLESaveToStream function. For information about the OLESaveToStream function, see the Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding Software Development Kit.
This destination has the following syntax:
<obj>( '' \object (<objtype> & <objmod>? & <objclass>? & <objname>? & <objtime>? & <objsize>? & <rsltmod>?) <objdata> <result> '' ) | <pubobject><objtype>\objemb | \objlink | \objautlink | \objsub | \objpub | \objicemb | objhtml | objocx<objmod>\linkself? & \objlock? | \objupdate?<objclass>'\*' \objclass #PCDATA ''<objname>'\*' \objname #PCDATA ''<objtime>'\*' \objtime <time> ''<rsltmod>\rsltmerge? & <rslttype>?<rslttype>\rsltrtf | \rslttxt | \rsltpict | \rsltbmp | \rslthtml<objsize>\objsetsize? & \objalign? & \objtransy? & <objhw>? & \objcropt? & \objcropb? & \objcropl? & \objcropr? & \objscalex? & \objscaley?<objhw>\objh & \objw<objdata>'\*' \objdata (<objalias>? & <objsect>?) <data> ''<objalias>'\*' \objalias <data> ''<objsect>'\*' \objsect <data> ''<result>'' \result <para>+ ''
These control words are described in the following table.
Control wordMeaningObject Type\objembAn object type of OLE embedded object. If no type is given for the object, the object is assumed to be of type \objemb.\objlinkAn object type of OLE link.\objautlinkAn object type of OLE autolink.\objsubAn object type of Macintosh Edition Manager subscriber.\objpubAn object type of Macintosh Edition Manager publisher.\objicembAn object type of MS Word for the Macintosh Installable Command (IC) Embedder.\objhtmlAn object type of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) control.\objocxAn object type of OLE control.Object Information\linkselfThe object is a link to another part of the same document.\objlockLocks the object from any updates.\objupdateForces an update to the object before displaying it. Note that this will override any values in the <objsize> control words, but values should always be provided for these to maintain backwards compatibility.\objclassThe text argument is the object class to use for this object; ignore the class specified in the object data. This is a destination control word.\objnameThe text argument is the name of this object. This is a destination control word.\objtimeLists the time that the object was last updated.Object Size, Position, Cropping, and Scaling\objhNN is the original object height in twips, assuming the object has a graphical representation.\objwNN is the original object width in twips, assuming the object has a graphical representation.\objsetsizeForces the object server to set the object's dimensions to the size specified by the client.\objalignNN is the distance in twips from the left edge of the objects that should be aligned on a tab stop. This is needed to place Equation Editor equations correctly.\objtransyNN is the distance in twips the objects should be moved vertically with respect to the baseline. This is needed to place Math Type equations correctly.\objcroptNN is the top cropping value in twips.\objcropbNN is the bottom cropping value in twips.\objcroplNN is the left cropping value in twips.\objcroprNN is the right cropping value in twips.\objscalexNN is the horizontal scaling percentage.\objscaleyNN is the vertical scaling percentage.Object Data\objdataThis subdestination contains the data for the object in the appropriate format; OLE objects are in OLESaveToStream format. This is a destination control word.\objaliasThis subdestination contains the alias record of the publisher object for the Macintosh Edition Manager. This is a destination control word.\objsectThis subdestination contains the section record of the publisher object for the Macintosh Edition Manager. This is a destination control word.Object Result\rsltrtfForces the result to be RTF, if possible.\rsltpictForces the result to be a Windows metafile or MacPict image format, if possible.\rsltbmpForces the result to be a bitmap, if possible.\rslttxtForces the result to be plain text, if possible.\rslthtmlForces the result to be HTML, if possible.\rsltmergeUses the formatting of the current result whenever a new result is obtained.\resultThe result destination is optional in the \object destination. The result destination contains the last update of the result of the object. The data of the result destination should be standard RTF. This allows RTF readers that don't understand objects or the type of object represented to use the current result, in place of the object, to maintain appearance. This is a destination control word.
When Word is used as an editor for Mail, the following control word can be emitted. Otherwise, it is not seen.
Control wordMeaning\objattphObject attachment placeholder. Used in the RTF stream when Word is started as an e-mail editor and the message contains attachments. The control word lists where in the text stream the attachment should be placed. It does not define the actual attachment.Macintosh Edition Manager Publisher Objects
Word for the Macintosh writes publisher objects for the Macintosh Edition Manager in terms of bookmarks (see the Bookmark section of this specification). The range of publisher objects are marked as bookmarks, so these controls are all used within the \bkmkstart destination. The RTF syntax for a publisher object is:
<pubobject>'\*' \bkmkstart \bkmkpub \pubauto? (<objalias>? & <objsect>) #PCDATA ''
These control words are descibed in the following table.
Control wordMeaning\bkmkpubThe bookmark identifies a Macintosh Edition Manager publisher object.\pubautoThe publisher object updates all Macintosh Edition Manager subscribers of this object automatically, whenever it is edited.Drawing Objects
Drawing Objects in Word 6.0/95 RTF
Drawing objects and the drawing primitives enumerated within drawing object groups use the following syntax:

Note that in <dpgroup> the number of <dpinfo> occurrences is equal to the argument of \dpcount. This means that in <dppolyline> the number of <dppt> occurrence is equal to the argument of \dppolycount.
The following elements of the drawing-object syntax pertain specifically to callout objects:
<cotype>\dpcotright | \dpcotsingle | \dpcotdouble | \dpcottriple<coangle>\dpcoa<coaccent>\dpcoaccent<cosmartattach>\dpcosmarta<cobestfit>\dpcobestfit<cominusx>\dpcominusx<cominusy>\dpcominusy<coborder>\dpcoborder<codescent>\dpcodtop | \dpcodcenter | \dpcodbottom | \dpcodabs
The remaining elements of the drawing object syntax are properties applied to individual drawn primitives. These remaining objects use the following syntax:

Word 97 through Word 2002 RTF for Drawing Objects (Shapes)
Basic Format
The basic format for drawing objects in RTF is as follows:
 \shp   ........   \*\shpinst   \spp   \sn ..........    \sp ..............     
             \shprslt   ...............    
The first destination (\shp) is always present. This control word groups everything related to a shape together. Following the destination change is basic information regarding the shape. The following keywords with values can appear in any order after the   \shp  control word.

Control wordMeaningShape Keywords\shpleftNSpecifies position of shape from the left of the anchor. The value N is a measurement in twips.\shptopNSpecifies position of shape from the top of the anchor. The value N is a measurement in twips.\shpbottomNSpecifies position of shape from the bottom of the anchor. The value N is a measurement in twips.\shprightNSpecifies position of shape from the right of the anchor. The value N is a measurement in twips.\shplidNA number that is unique to each shape. This keyword is primarily used for linked text boxes. The value N is a long integer.\shpzNDescribes the z-order of the shape. It starts at 0 for the shape that is furthest from the top, and proceeds to the top most shape (N). The shapes that appear inside the header document will have a separate z-order, compared to the z-order of the shapes in the main document.

 \shptxt  Any valid RTF for the current text box 
Note For linked text boxes, the first text box of the linked set has the entire story, so all following text boxes will not have a \shptxt field.\shprsltThis is where the Word 6.0 and Word 95 drawn object RTF can be placed. \shpgrpSpecifies a group shape. The parameters following this keyword are the same as those following \shp. The order of the shapes inside a group is from bottom to top in z-order. 
Inside of a \shpgrp, no  \shprslt ....  fields would be generated (that is, only the root-level shape can have a \shprslt field (this field describes the entire group). For example:
 \shpgrp  .......  \shp ..... (and all sub-items as usual) 
            \shp ......(and all sub-items as usual) 
Note  \shpgrp ......  can be substituted for  \shp .....  in order to create groups inside of groups.
With the exception of \shplid, the control words listed in the preceding table do not apply for shapes that are within a group. For more information about groups, see the Introduction section of this specification.

Control wordMeaning\backgroundSpecifies the document background. This is a destination control word. It contains the  \shp keyword and all the shape properties.
Drawing Object Properties
The bulk of a drawing object is defined as a series of properties. The  \shp ............ control word is followed by  \*\shpinst  Following the  \*\shpinst   is a list of all the properties of a shape. Each of the properties is in the following format:

 \sp   \sn PropertyName   \sv PropertyValueInformation  

The control word for the drawing object property is \sp. Each property has a pair of name (\sn) and value (\sv) control words placed in the shape property group. For example, the vertical flip property is represented as:
\sp\sn fFlipV\sv 1

Here, the name of the property is fFlipV and the value is 1, which indicates True. All shape properties follow this basic format. Only properties that have been explicitly set for a shape are written out in RTF. Other properties assume the default values (a property may be set to the default value explicitly). 
The following table describes all the names of properties for drawing objects along with their corresponding value type.

There are 12,700 EMU units in a point hence 914,400 in an inch and 360,000 cm-1. Fractional or fixed values are expressed using units that are 1/65536th of a whole. Angles are expressed as fractions of a degree. Colors are 24-bit color values. Booleans have two possible values: 1 for True and 0 for False. 
Arrays are formatted as a sequence of numbers separated by semicolons. The first number tells the size of each element in the array in bytes. The number of bytes per element may be 2, 4, or 8. When the size of the element is 8, each element is represented as a group of two numbers. The second number tells the number of elements in the array. For example, the points of a square polygon are written as:
sv 8;4;0,0;100,0;100,100;0,100
The ShapeType property can have the following possible values.

The following keywords are related to defining a hyperlink hanging off of a shape (that is, all of them are inside of a \sp \sn …  \sp …). These specifically can occur in the \sp to define a property that is a hyperlink. They are used in the following way:
 \hl   \hlloc  RTF-string   \hlsrc RTF-string   \hlfr RTF-string  
The three groups can be in any order and provide the three strings needed to fully describe a hyperlink. The control words are described in the following table.
Control wordMeaning\hllocLocation string for hyperlink.\hlsrcSource string for hyperlink.\hlfrFriendly name for hyperlink.

Footnotes
The \footnote control word introduces a footnote. Footnotes are destinations in RTF. A footnote is anchored to the character that immediately precedes the footnote destination (that is, the footnote moves with the character to which it is anchored). If automatic footnote numbering is defined, the destination can be preceded by a footnote reference character, identified by the control word \chftn. Microsoft products do not support footnotes within headers, footers, or comments (annotations). Placing a footnote within headers, footers, or comments will often result in a corrupted document.
Footnotes have the following syntax:
<foot>'' \footnote <para>+ ''Here is an example of a destination containing footnotes:

To indicate endnotes, the following combination is emitted: \footnote\ftnalt. Existing readers will ignore the \ftnalt control word and treat everything as a footnote. 
For other control words relating to footnotes, see the sections titled Document Formatting Properties, Section Formatting Properties, and Special Characters in this specification
Comments (Annotations)
RTF comments (annotations) have two parts; the author ID (introduced by the control word \atnid) and the annotation text (introduced by the control word \annotation); there is no group enclosing both parts. Microsoft products do not support comments within headers, footers, or footnotes. Placing an annotation within headers, footers, or footnotes will often result in a corrupted document. Each part of the annotation is an RTF destination. Comments are anchored to the character that immediately precedes the annotation.
If an annotation is associated with an annotation bookmark, the following two destination control words precede and follow the bookmark. The alphanumeric string N, such as a long integer, represents the bookmark name.
<atrfstart>'\*' \atrfstart N ''<atrfend>'\*' \atrfend N ''
Comments have the following syntax:
<annot><annotid> <atnauthor> <atntime>? \chatn <atnicn>? <annotdef> <annotid>'\*' \atnid #PCDATA ''<atnauthor>'\*' \atnauthor #PCDATA ''<annotdef>'\*' \annotation <atndate>? <atnref> <atnparent> <para>+ ''<atnref>'\*' \atnref N ''<atntime>'\*' \atntime <time> ''<atndate>\* \atndate <date> <atnparent>\* \atnparent <annotid of parent> <atnicn>'\*' \atnicn <pict> ''
The following is an example of annotation text:

That is what this paper is about. 
Comments may have optional time stamps (contained in the \atntime destination), date stamps (contained in the \atndate destination), or icons (contained in the \atnicn destination).
Fields
The \field control word introduces a field destination, which contains the text of fields. Fields have the following syntax:
<field>'' \field <fieldmod>? <fieldinst> <fieldrslt> ''<fieldmod>\flddirty? & \fldedit? & \fldlock? & \fldpriv?<fieldinst>'\*' \fldinst <para>+ <fldalt>? ''<fldalt>\fldalt<fieldrslt>'' \fldrslt <para>+ ''
There are several control words that alter the interpretation of the field. These control words are listed in the following table.
Control wordMeaning\flddirtyA formatting change has been made to the field result since the field was last updated.\fldeditText has been added to, or removed from, the field result since the field was last updated.\fldlockField is locked and cannot be updated.\fldprivResult is not in a form suitable for display (for example, binary data used by fields whose result is a picture).
Two subdestinations are required within the \field destination. They must be enclosed in braces ( ) and begin with the following control words.
Control wordMeaning\fldinstField instructions. This is a destination control word.\fldrsltMost recent calculated result of the field. This is a destination control word.
If the instruction for a field contains a file name, then the \cpg control can be used to define the character set of the file name. See Code Page Support in this specification for details.
The \fldrslt control word should be included even if no result has been calculated because most readers (even those readers that do not recognize fields) can generally include the value of the \fldrslt destination in the document. A field result should not start with a table, because this will break some RTF readers.
The following is an example of some field text:
\field \*\fldinst AUTHOR \\*MERGEFORMAT\fldrslt Joe Smith\par\pard
\field\*\fldinst time \\@ "h:mm AM/PM"\fldrslt 8:12 AM
You can use the \fldalt control word to specify that the given field reference is to an endnote. For example, the following field in RTF is a reference to a footnote
\field\*\fldinst NOTEREF _RefNumber  \fldrslt 1
The following is an example of a reference to an endnote
\field\*\fldinst NOTEREF _RefNumber \fldalt  \fldrslt I
If the specified field is a form field, the \*\datafield destination appears as a part of <char> and contains the binary data of a form field instruction. For example:
\field\*\fldinst \*\bkmkstart Text1 FORMTEXT \*\datafield 
00000000000000000554657874310008476565207768697a0000000000000000000000\fldrslt Default Result\*\bkmkend Text1
Note that the \datafield destination requires the \* prefix. The \fldtype, \date, \time, and \wpeqn field keywords should be ignored.

This is a destination control word. \ffresNResult field for a form field. Values from 0 to N-1, where N is the number of \ffl entries.Index Entries
The \xe control word introduces an index entry. Index entries in RTF are destinations. An index entry has the following syntax:
<idx>'' \xe (\xef? & \bxe? & \ixe?) <entry> (<txe> | <rxe>)? ''<entry>(<char>+ <yxe>?) | ('' <char>+ <yxe>? '')<yxe>\yxe <char>+ #PCDATA<txe>'' \txe <char>+ #PCDATA''<rxe>'' \rxe #PCDATA ''
If the text of the index entry is not formatted as hidden text with the \v control word, then the text is put into the document as well as into the index. Similarly, the text of the \txe subdestination, described later in this section, becomes part of the document if it is not formatted as hidden text. For more information on the \v control word, see Font/Character Formatting Properties in this specification. 
The following control words may also be used.
Control wordMeaning\xefNAllows multiple indexes within the same document. N is an integer that corresponds to the ASCII value of a letter between A and Z.\bxeFormats the page number or cross-reference in bold.\ixeFormats the page number or cross-reference in italic.\txe TextText argument to be used instead of a page number.

This is a destination control word.\yxePronunciation (or heading) for index entry, used in phonetic sorting.\*\pxe"Yomi" (pronunciation) for index entry.Table of Contents Entries
The \tc control word introduces a table of contents entry, which can be used to build the actual table of contents. The \tcn control word marks a table of contents entry that will not have a page number associated with it; this is used in place of \tc for such entries. Table of contents entries are destinations, and they have the following syntax:
<toc>'' \tc | \tcn (\tcf? & \tcl?) <char>+ ''As with index entries, text that is not formatted as hidden with the \v character-formatting control word is put into the document. The following control words can also be used in this destination.
Control wordMeaning\tcfNType of table being compiled. N is mapped by existing Microsoft software to a letter between A and Z (the default is 67, which maps to C, used for tables of contents).\tclNLevel number (the default is 1).Bidirectional Language Support
RTF supports bidirectional writing orders for languages such as Arabic. The controls are described in the following table (as well as in the appropriate sections throughout this specification). Also refer to the associated character properties defined in Associated Character Properties in this specification.
All the control words relating to bidirectional language support are repeated here for convenience.

Far East Support
Word 2000 contains full support for all Far East features introduced in all previous Asian versions of Word and it has the ability to read and write RTF keywords related to such features. This section provides details on the handling of Far East characters. For more information on handling Far East features, see the appropriate subsection in the Contents of an RTF File section in this document.
Escaped Expressions
An escaped expression (for example, \'hh, \\, or \) is usable in all RTF control words.
Writer
In general RTF should be written out with all characters above 0x80 in the escaped form, \'hh. The following table shows values for character codes.
Character codeWrite out as0x00 <= ch < 0x20Escaped (\'hh)0x20 <= ch < 0x80Raw (non-escaped) character0x80 <= ch <= 0xFFEscaped (\'hh)0x5C, 0x7B, 0x7D (special RTF characters \,, or )Escaped (\'hh)
Reader
When the RTF reader encounters raw characters in the leading-byte range of the double-byte character, it regards the next character as the trailing byte of the double-byte character and combines the two characters into one double-byte character. The following table shows possible byte combinations.
Leading byteTrailing byteValidityEscapedRaw (0x20 <= ch <= 0x7f) Valid (standard format for double-byte character)EscapedEscaped (other)Valid (standard format for double-byte character)RawRawValid (RTF-J format for double-byte character)RawEscapedInvalid
Note that characters that are special RTF symbols (\,, or ) should always be escaped, preferably using the \hh syntax.
Character Set
Word J specifies the character set in the font table using \fcharset. Word J interprets \cpg437 as \fcharset0 and \cpg932 as \fcharset128 if it encounters these control words when reading RTF. If both \fcharset and \cpg appear in the font table, \cpg is ignored.
Character Mapping
Word maps single-byte characters according to character set information (for example, Macintosh to ANSI) and leaves double-byte characters unmapped.
Font Family
RTF-J control wordsDefinition and the interpretation in Word\jis RTF-J uses \jis as a control word for character set. Word J interprets this as \ansi, which is the default character set used if the character set is not defined.\fjminchou and \fjgothicRTF-J uses \fjminchou and \fjgothic to specify font family. Word J interprets these as \fnil, which is the default font family. ShiftJIS Font Without \cpg or \fcharset
If \cpg or \fcharset control words are not present, Word J uses the text metrics of the font before determining the character set of these fonts. If the font is unknown, Word J assumes it is SHIFTJIS_CHARSET.
Composite Fonts (Associated Fonts for International Runs)
Word J defines control words to specify composite fonts as associated character properties. These control words follow the rule of associated character properties and understand font designation (\af). All other <aprops> are ignored in Word J. Composite fonts have the following syntax:
<atext><losbrun> | <hisbrun> | <dbrun><losbrun>\hich \af & <aprops> \dbch \af & <aprops> \loch <ptext><hisbrun>\loch \af & <aprops> \dbch \af & <aprops> \hich <ptext><dbrun>\loch \af & <aprops> \hich \af & <aprops> \dbch <ptext>These control words are described in the following table.
Control wordMeaning\lochSpecifies a run of the characters in the low-ANSI (0x000x7F) area.\hichFor the characters in the high-ANSI (0x80-0xFF) area.\dbchSpecifies a run of the double-byte characters.
Word J writes out associated character properties in the styles. In the style sheet, the <dbrun> definition should be used for compatibility with applications that have transparent readers.
\stylesheet\loch\af5\hich\af5\dbch\f27\fs20\snext0 Normal;
If the composite font definition matches the style, only the control word (\loch, \hich, or \dbch) will be used to distinguish the type of run, along with the font information for transparent readers.
\fonttbl\f5\fswiss\fcharset0\fprq2 Arial;\f27\froman\fcharset128\fprq1 Mincho;
\stylesheet\loch\af5\hich\af5\dbch\f27\fs20\snext0 Normal;

\dbch\f27\'82\'c5\'82\'b7\'81B
\par
If one or all of \loch, \hich, and \dbch are missing from the style sheet definition (or the character set does not match), Word J will apply the following fonts to each character run in the style using the bulleted rules in the next paragraph.
Control wordFont Word J applies\lochSame font as \f.\hichAny font whose character set is ANSI_CHARSET.\dbchAny font whose character set is SHIFTJIS_CHARSET.
If the composite font control words are missing from the character run, Word J will interpret all characters below 0x80 as a \loch run. Characters above or equal to 0x80 will be determined using the following rules:
If the character is in the leading-byte range and the next character is in the trailing-byte range of a double-byte character, it will be treated as a \dbch run (one double-byte character). For example,

If the character is in the leading-byte range of a double-byte character but the next character is not in the trailing-byte range, it will be treated as a \hich run (two high-ANSI or low-ANSI characters). For example,
\'99\'FF‡ÿ
If the character is in the leading-byte range of a double-byte character and is the last character in the run, it will be treated as a \hich run (one high-ANSI character). For example,
\'99\par‡
If the character is not in the leading-byte range of a double-byte character, it will be treated as a \hich run (one high-ANSI character). For example,

How to Write an RTF Reader
There are three basic things that an RTF reader must do:
1.Separate text from RTF controls.
2.Parse an RTF control.
3.Dispatch an RTF control.
Separating text from RTF controls is relatively simple, because all RTF controls begin with a backslash. Therefore, any incoming character that is not a backslash is text and will be handled as text. 
Parsing an RTF control is also relatively simple. An RTF control is either (a) a sequence of alphabetic characters followed by an optional numeric parameter, or (b) a single non-alphanumeric character. 
Dispatching an RTF control, on the other hand, is relatively complicated. A recursive-descent parser tends to be overly strict because RTF is intentionally vague about the order of various properties relative to one another. However, whatever method you use to dispatch an RTF control, your RTF reader should do the following:
∑Ignore control words you dont understand
Many RTF readers crash when they come across an unknown RTF control. Because Microsoft is continually adding new RTF controls, this limits an RTF reader to working with the RTF from one particular product (usually some version of Word for Windows).
∑Always understand \*
One of the most important things an RTF reader can do is to understand the \* control. This control introduces a destination that is not part of the document. It tells the RTF reader that if the reader does not understand the next control word, then it should skip the entire enclosing group. 
∑Remember that binary data can occur when youre skipping RTF
A simple way to skip a group in RTF is to keep a running count of the opening braces that the RTF reader has encountered in the RTF stream. When the RTF reader sees an opening brace, it increments the count. When the reader sees a closing brace, it decrements the count. When the count becomes negative, the end of the group has been found. Unfortunately, this doesnt work when the RTF file contains a \bin control; the reader must explicitly check each control word found to see if it is a \bin control, and, if a \bin control is found, skip that many bytes before resuming its scanning for braces.
A Sample RTF Reader Implementation
The Microsoft Word Processing Conversions group uses a table-driven approach to reading RTF. This approach allows the most flexibility in reading RTF but makes it difficult to detect incorrect RTF. An RTF reader that is based on this approach is presented in this section. This reader works exactly as described in the RTF specification and uses the principles of operation described in the RTF specification as well. This reader is designed to be simple to understand but is not intended to be very efficient. This RTF reader also implements the three design principles listed in the previous section.
The RTF reader consists of the following four files:
∑Rtfdecl.h, which contains the prototypes for all the functions in the RTF reader
∑Rtftype.h, which contains the types used in the RTF reader
∑Rtfreadr.c, which contains the main program, the main loop of the RTF reader, and the RTF control parser
∑Rtfactn.c, which contains the dispatch routines for the RTF reader
Rtfdecl.h 
Rtfdecl.h is straightforward and requires little explanation.
Rtfreadr.c
Like rtfdecl.h, rtfreadr.c is also reasonably straightforward. The function ecRtfParse separates text from RTF controls and handles text, and the function ecParseRtfKeyword parses an RTF control and also collects any parameter that follows the RTF control.
Rtftype.h
Rtftype.h begins by declaring a sample set of character, paragraph, section, and document properties. These structures are present to demonstrate how the dispatch routines can modify any particular property and are not actually used to format text.
For example, the following enumeration describes which destination text should be routed to:
typedef enum  rdsNorm, rdsSkip  RDS;
Because this is just a sample RTF reader, there are only two destinations. A more complicated reader would add an entry to this enumeration for each destination supported [for example, headers, footnotes, endnotes, comments (annotations), bookmarks, and pictures].
The following enumeration describes the internal state of the RTF parser:
typedef enum  risNorm, risBin, risHex  RIS;
This is entirely separate from the state of the dispatch routines and the destination state; other RTF readers may not necessarily have anything similar to this.
The following structure encapsulates the state that must be saved at a group start and restored at a group end:
typedef struct save

struct save *pNext;
CHP chp;
PAP pap;
SEP sep;
DOP dop;
RDS rds;
RIS ris;
 SAVE;
The following enumeration describes a set of classes for RTF controls:
typedef enum kwdChar, kwdDest, kwdProp, kwdSpec KWD;
Use kwdChar for controls that represent special characters (such as \-, \, or \).
Use kwdDest for controls that introduce RTF destinations.
Use kwdProp for controls that modify some sort of property.
Use kwdSpec for controls that need to run some specialized code.
The following enumeration defines the number of PROP structures (described later) that will be used. There will typically be an iprop for every field in the character, paragraph, section, and document properties.
typedef enum ipropBold, ipropItalic, ipropUnderline, ipropLeftInd,
ipropRightInd, ipropFirstInd, ipropCols, ipropPgnX, ipropPgnY,
ipropXaPage, ipropYaPage, ipropXaLeft, ipropXaRight,
ipropYaTop, ipropYaBottom, ipropPgnStart, ipropSbk, 
ipropPgnFormat, ipropFacingp, ipropLandscape, ipropJust,
ipropPard, ipropPlain,
ipropMax IPROP;
The following structure is a very compact way to describe how to locate the address of a particular value in one of the property structures:
typedef enum actnSpec, actnByte, actnWord ACTN;
typedef enum propChp, propPap, propSep, propDop PROPTYPE;

typedef struct propmod

ACTN actn;
PROPTYPE prop;
int offset;
 PROP;
The actn field describes the width of the value being described: if the value is a byte, then actn is actnByte; if the value is a word, then actn is actnWord; if the value is neither a byte nor a word, then you can use actnSpec to indicate that some C code needs to be run to set the value. The prop field indicates which property structure is being described; propChp indicates that the value is located within the CHP structure; propPap indicates that the value is located within the PAP structure, and so on. Finally, the offset field contains the offset of the value from the start of the structure. The offsetof() macro is usually used to initialize this field.
The following structure describes how to parse a particular RTF control:
typedef enum ipfnBin, ipfnHex, ipfnSkipDest  IPFN;
typedef enum idestPict, idestSkip  IDEST;

typedef struct symbol

char *szKeyword;
int dflt;
bool fPassDflt;
KWD kwd;
int idx;
 SYM;
szKeyword points to the RTF control being described; kwd describes the class of the particular RTF control (described earlier); dflt is the default value for this control, and fPassDflt should be nonzero if the value in dflt should be passed to the dispatch routine. 
Note  fPassDflt is only nonzero for control words that normally set a particular value. For example, the various section break controls typically have nonzero fPassDflt controls, but controls that take parameters should not.
Idx is a generalized index; its use depends on the kwd being used for this control.
∑If kwd is kwdChar, then idx is the character that should be output.
∑If kwd is kwdDest, then idx is the idest for the new destination.
∑If kwd is kwdProp, then idx is the iprop for the appropriate property.
∑If kwd is kwdSpec, then idx is an ipfn for the appropriate function.
With this structure it is very simple to dispatch an RTF control word. Once the reader isolates the RTF control word and its (possibly associated) value, the reader then searches an array of SYM structures to find the RTF control word. If the control word is not found, the RTF reader ignores it, unless the previous control was \*, in which case the reader must scan past an entire group.
If the control word is found, the reader then uses the kwd value from the SYM structure to determine what to do. This is, in fact, exactly what the function ecTranslateKeyword in the file RTFACTN.C does. 
Rtfactn.c
Rtfactn.c contains the tables describing the properties and control words, and the routines to evaluate properties (ecApplyPropChange) and to dispatch control words (ecTranslateKeyword).
The tables are the keys to understanding the RTF dispatch routines. The following are some sample entries from both tables, along with a brief explanation of each entry.
Property Table 
This table must have an entry for every iprop. 
actnByte,   propChp,    offsetof(CHP, fBold),       // ipropBold
This property says that the ipropBold property is a byte parameter bound to chp.fBold.
actnWord,   propPap,    offsetof(PAP, xaRight),     // ipropRightInd
This property says that ipropRightInd is a word parameter bound to pap.xaRight.
actnWord,   propSep,    offsetof(SEP, cCols),       // ipropCols
This property says that ipropCols is a word parameter bound to sep.cCols.
actnSpec,   propChp,    0,                          // ipropPlain
This property says that ipropPlain is a special parameter. Instead of directly evaluating it, ecApplyPropChange will run some custom C code to apply a property change.
Control Word Table
"b",        1,      fFalse,     kwdProp,    ipropBold,
This structure says that the control \b sets the ipropBold property. Because fPassDflt is False, the RTF reader only uses the default value if the control does not have a parameter. If no parameter is provided, the RTF reader uses a value of 1.
"sbknone",  sbkNon, fTrue,      kwdProp,    ipropSbk,
This entry says that the control \sbknone sets the ipropSbk property. Because fPassDflt is True, the RTF reader always uses the default value of sbkNon, even if the control has a parameter.
"par",      0,      fFalse,     kwdChar,    0x0a,
This entry says that the control \par is equivalent to a 0x0a (linefeed) character.
"tab",      0,      fFalse,     kwdChar,    0x09,
This entry says that the control \tab is equivalent to a 0x09 (tab) character.
"bin",      0,      fFalse,     kwdSpec,    ipfnBin,
This entry says that the control \bin should run some C code. The particular piece of C code can be located by the ipfnBin parameter.
"fonttbl",  0,      fFalse,     kwdDest,    idestSkip,
This entry says that the control \fonttbl should change to the destination idestSkip.
Notes on Implementing Other RTF Features
The table-driven approach to dispatching RTF controls used by the sample converter does not implement any syntax checking. For most controls this is not a problem; a control simply modifies the appropriate property. However, some controls, such as those for tabs and borders, are dependent on other control words either before or after the current control word.
There are some standard techniques for handling these features.
Tabs and Other Control Sequences Terminating in a Fixed Control
The best way to implement these types of control sequences is to have a global structure that represents the current state of the tab descriptor (or other entity). As the modifiers come in, they modify the various fields of the global structure. When the fixed control at the end of the sequence is dispatched, it adds the entire descriptor and reinitializes the global variable.
Borders and Other Control Sequences Beginning with a Fixed Control
The best way to implement these types of control sequences is to have a global pointer that is initialized when the fixed control is dispatched. The controls that modify the fixed control then modify fields pointed to by the control.
Other Problem Areas in RTF
Style Sheets
Style sheets can be handled as destinations. However, styles have default values, just as every other control does. RTF readers should be sure to handle a missing style control as the default style value (that is, 0).
Property Changes
Some RTF readers use various bits of RTF syntax to mark property changes. In particular, they assume that property changes will occur only after a group start, which is not correct. Because there is a variety of ways to represent identical property changes in RTF, RTF readers should look at the changes in the properties and not at any particular way of representing a property change. In particular, properties can be changed explicitly with a control word or implicitly at the end of a group. For example, these three sequences of RTF have exactly the same semantics, and should be translated identically:
∑\b bold \i Bold Italic \i0 Bold again
∑\b bold \i Bold Italic Bold again
∑\b bold \i Bold Italic \plain\b Bold again
Fields
All versions of Microsoft Word for Windows and version 6.0 and later of Microsoft Word for the Macintosh have fields. If you are writing an RTF reader and expect to do anything with fields, keep the following notes in mind:
∑Field instructions may have arbitrary amounts of character formatting and arbitrarily nested groups. While the groups will be properly nested within the field instructions, you may already be inside an arbitrary number of groups by the time you know which field you are working with. If you then expect to be able to skip to the end of the field instructions, youll have to know how many groups have started so that you can skip to the end properly.
∑Some fields, the INCLUDE field in particular, can have section breaks in the field results. If this occurs, then the text after the end of the field does not have the same section properties as the text at the start of the field. Therefore, the section properties must not be restored when the field results contain section breaks.
Tables
Tables are probably the hardest part of RTF to read and write correctly. Because of the way Microsoft word processors implement tables, and the table-driven approach of many Microsoft RTF readers, it is very easy to write tables in RTF that are not compatible with Microsoft word processors when you try to read the RTF. Here are some guidelines to reduce problems with tables in RTF:
∑Place the entire table definition before any paragraph properties, including \pard.
∑Verify that the number of cells in the RTF matches the number of cell definitions.
∑Some controls must be the same in all paragraphs in a row. In particular, all paragraphs in a row must have the same positioning controls, and all paragraphs in a row must have \intbl specified.
∑Do not use the \sbys control inside a table. \sbys is a holdover from Word for MS-DOS and early versions of Word for the Macintosh. Word for Windows and current versions of Word for the Macintosh translate \sbys as a table. 
∑Cell definitions starting before the left margin of the paper begins (that is, the parameter plus the left margin is negative) are always in error.Appendix A-1: Listings

Appendix B: Index of RTF Control Words
The control word table contains a list of each RTF control word, the name of the section where it may be found, and its type. The types are described in the following table.
TypeMeaningFlagThis control word ignores any parameter.DestinationThis control word starts a group or destination. It ignores any parameter.SymbolThis control word represents a special character.ToggleThis control word distinguishes between the ON and OFF states for the given property. The control word with no parameter or a nonzero parameter is used to turn on the property, while the control word with a zero parameter is used to turn it off.ValueThis control word requires a parameter.
Note In the following comprehensive table, the names of all control words added in version 7.0 or later are flagged with the version number in which they were added (7.0, 97, 2000, and 2002).

Appendix C: Control Words introduced by other Microsoft Products
Pocket Word
Control wordMeaning\pwdNSubstitute for \rtfN. Introduced by Pocket Word to distinguish its files from general RTF files. Currently only 1 is emitted and the number is ignored by the RTF reader.\collapsedParagraph property active in outline view that specifies that the paragraph is collapsed (not viewed).\urtfNIdentifies an RTF file in which all text characters are encoded in UTF-8. Only binary data escapes this transformation. Word does not read this encoding of RTF.
Exchange (Used in RTF<->HTML Conversions)
Control wordMeaning\fromtext  Indicates that the document was originally a plain text document.\fromhtmlIndicates that the document was originally HTML and may contain encapsulated HTML tags. This keyword may be followed by a version number (currently 1).\*\htmltagIndicates that the destination is encapsulated HTML text (to be ignored by RTF readers, but used during reverse RTF->HTML conversion). This keyword is followed by a numeric parameter containing encapsulation flags.\htmlrtfToggling keyword to mark pieces of RTF to be ignored during reverse RTF->HTML conversion. Lack of a parameter turns it on, parameter 0 turns it off.\*\mhtmltagIndicates that the destination is an encapsulated tag with rewritten URL links that should be used in a conversion to plain HTML. Typically, URL links are rewritten as automatically generated MHTML reference names or as absolute external links. The keyword is followed by the flag parameter (the same one as for the \htmltag keyword).\htmlbase Placeholder in front of encapsulated MHTML reference name that marks the place where the base URL should be appended. This keyword is only used inside the \mhtmltag destination.
